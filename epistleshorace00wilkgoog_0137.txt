EPISTLE 11.

This epistle is addressed to Lollius Maximus, probably the
elder son of M. Lollius, to whom Carm.1v. 9 was afterwards
addressed. The date of the Epistle is not certain. The
eighteenth epistle of this book is also addressed to the same
Lollius, and we leam from that (v. 55) that he had served under

puer in v. 68 is not inconsistent with a date a year or two

was studying under Molo at the age of twenty-eight. The
date of Ep. xv111. is fixed by v. 56 at nc. ro, aud that appears
tobecertainly later than the present one. ·
