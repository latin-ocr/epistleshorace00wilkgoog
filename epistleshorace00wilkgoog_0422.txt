trate the style too low for the satyric drama: ‘chiselled’.
Terence once (Phonn. 682 emunxi argento senes) uts it into the'
mouth oi a slave, Plautus has the phrase more dequently: cp.
E id. 494 qui me cntunxirti mucidum minumipreti : Most. 1108
Tk. dedisti verba. Tr. qui tandem? Th. probe med emunxti.
Cruquius took the metaphor to be one os ‘milking’, but the
context ln the last passage, and the use of the Greek teratrum
(cp. Menand. Fragm. 482 γέρων trentam? ἅθλιος) make it clear
thatthisisnotthecase. Bentley’semendation.accordingtowhich
this word is read in ,Caecilius ap. cic. Lael. 26, 99, is not to be

240. ex noto notum carmen mcum. Horace has been
speaking hitherto only of the languagt oi the satyric drama, and
to this he returns in v. 244: hence most editors erplain camma

andex noto ‘out os familiar materials¹. Schiitz doubts whether
curnun can fairly bear this meaning, and holds that the scholiasts
are right in taking it to reser to the substance of the poem. In

that case the verses must be out of place here: they must either ,

be transposed to aiter v. τ 50, or else (as Schiitz suggests) finda
place somewhere in the passage vv. 125—135, or be rejected
altogether with Ribbeck. They are‘too good in themselves ior

us readily to accept the last alternative, and carmen may, 1
think, fairly reser to the style. · '
