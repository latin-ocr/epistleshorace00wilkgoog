Paamium videri doctiorem, quiesse docti adfectant, uolunt. The
form Attius seems to be the one found in the best MSS. of
Quintilian (cp. Halm): on the other hand no MS. whatever has
that sorm here, and on Cic. de Orat. 111. 7, 27 Ellendt says ‘a
libris standum, qui, quod sciam, ubique sere tr ignorant’. Cp.
Teuffel Ram. Lit. ξ 119, 1 ‘The equally well-attested forms
Attius and Accius may be owing to a dialectical difference [?].
In the Imperial period, the form with tt gained the ascendancy,
and the Greeks always wrote Ἀττιος’. 11 is singular that the
evidence should be so divided‚ seeing how rare it isto fiudci
and a· confused in early authorities. C . Roby 1⁴. p. Lu,
Corssen Auss acher. 50—67‚ 11. ¹003· oth in Horace and in
Quintilian a (dh MSS. have Actius. Ribbeck iri his Fragmenta
Tragicarum (1871) adopted the form Attius, but 111 his Ir'o'nr.
Trag. (1875) he always has Accius.

Both Pacuvius and Accius attained to a great age, but pro·
bably senis means only ‘writer of the olden time' here, as in
Sat. 11. 1, 34, ol Lucilius. '

Porph. The togatae were comedies, depicting Roman or Italian
characters and manners, as opposed .to the palliatae, comedies
like 'those os Plautus and Terence derived from Greek sources,
and retaining Greek dramatis personae. L. Afranius was the
chief writer os togatae, born about B.c. 150: his plays were of a
very immoral character (cp. Quintil. x. l, 1003 Auson. Epigr,
Lxxl. 4), but in style they attained to something o'l the elegance
of Terence. He freely horrowed from Menander, as wellas from
other writers (cp. Macrob. Sat. vt. r, 4 Afranius togatarum
scriptor...nan inverecunde respondens arguentibus quod plura
sumpsis‘set a Menandro ‘Fateor’, inquit ‘sumpsi nan ab illa mado
sedat quisque haberit conveniret quad milri, quad me nan passe

meliusfaccre crederit, etiam a Latina') and tbe' critics pronounced
that bis style was worthy of his model. ’ ’ =

58. ad exemplar Epicharmi: Orelli justly says that itis very'
difficult to determine the exact meaning ot this line, because we
have not the means of comparing Plautus with Epicharmus, of
whose comedies we have few considerable fragments preserved.
He thinks that properare=ad eventum festinare (A. P. 148), and
that it refers to the rapid progress os the action ol the plays. So
τοο· Teuffel ἕ 7, a. Schiitz understands it of rapidityof produc·
tion.³ Mah y says that ‘it seems only to apply to the easy flov'r
ot the dialogue' (Greek Lit. 1, p. 403); but Sellar is more nearly
right in extending it to ‘the extreme vivacity' and rapidlty of
gesture, dialogue, declamation and recitative, by which his scenes
’ were characterised’ (Roman Parta, p. 194). It must always be
remembe'rerl, though many critics seem to sorget this, that Horace
