writes nebda gladiator post multas palmas consecratis Herculi
Fundano armas tandem in agellum se contulit: there seems to be
no positive evidence that gladiators were regarded as under the
protection of Hercules3 but this god would be as naturall
selected by a gladiator, as the nymphs by a fisherman Anth. Psi

Cp. Carm. 111. 16, 11. As the temple of Hercules at Fundi was
well known, it does not follow, as Ritter thinks that the ager must
have been in its neighbourhood: the term is here quite general,
fin the country.’ For the case cp. Roby§ 1174, S. G. ἓ 489. '

t. extrema harena, ie. at the outside edge of the circus,
under the podium, where the more distinguished spectato'rs had
their seats. Acron tells us, though possibly without any authority
beyond that of this passage, that gladiators who were suing for
their discharge (petituri rudem) used to betake themselves to the
iiie ἰξῗξ ttttlhltltttlllttt ‘ttillffhllptt

took in their profession. Cp. Friedlender Sitteng.11³p.363. Most
modern editors accept this view, but it is open to grave objection.
Veianius, Horace says, hung up his arms in the temple of Her·
cules, and retired to the country, abandoning altogether his pro·
fession. Why? That he might not have so frequently to impone
the people to request his master to give him his discharge? But
he must have received his discharge already, if it was possible for
him to retire. Why theu continue to beg for it? But we know Ἰ
from Suet. Tib. 7 (munus gladiatorium dedit, rudiorits quibus·
dam reuocatis auctoramento centenum nulium) that veterans who
had received their discharge were sometimes induced to re·appear
on special occasions. Veianiusafter his discharge, retired al·
together that he might not aster so many victories break down
and be compelled again and again to appeal as a defeated com·
batant for the mercy of the spectators. The desire that mercy
should be shown to a defeated gladiator was expressed by turning
down the thumbs (Plin. xxvm. a, 5 pollices, cum foveamus,
premere etiam prouerbio iubemur: cp. Ep. 1. 18, 66, Juv. 111. 36
with Mayor's note). The illustration thus becomes more closely
parallel with the metaphor os the racc-horse which follows.

As exoro has in itself always the meaning ‘to prevail upon ⁹,
we must here press the imperfect force of the present ‘attempt to
prevail upon’: Roby§ 1454, 3, S.G. ἓ 591.

't' purgatum, ‘well rinsed,’ for which purpose vinegar was
sometimes used, as we learn from Pers. v. 86. qut: for the
‘inner voice ' cp. ib. v, 96 stat cantra ratio et secretam gannit in
aurem.
