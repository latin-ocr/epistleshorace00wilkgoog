leaves is suggested as much as the loss os old ones. It is doubt·
iul however whether soliis can mean by itseli ‘by the growth ol
new leaves‘. even with the antithesis os prima cadunt: the pas-
sages quoted by Vahlen (on Aristot. Poetik² p. 88) by no means
suffice to establish this. A mediaeval commentary paraphrases
prima, scilicet, stultia, cadunt, nova succrescunt, ita vaur aetas
verborum, id cst, verba in vetere aetate iuventa intereunt, et modo
nata...florent. Hence Prot. Nettleship (Journal of Philology, ·
ΧΗ. 51) suggests that the line originally ran prima cadant, nova
succrescunt ,· vetus interit aetat: the words ita vernam having
been originally a gloss upon aetas: and thisbe finds confirmed
bya passage iu Jerome which runs(cua1)alia unierit generatio
primisque cadentibus fhliis virens ar'lna succreuen‘t. Lehrs had
already suggested the loss ol aliae alteru. 60in which succresmnt
occurred. The only difficulty as to accepting Nettleship's inge·
nious suggestion is the doubt whether verborum can be spared.

· alre receptus etc. The western coast ol Italy was very
deficient in good harbours (though not so bad as the eastern, but
cp. Cic. de Orat. 111. 19, 69). Hence at the time when Sextus
Pompeius was threatening Rome with a strong fleet, Agrippa,
the adrniral oi Augustus, lound it necessary to construet an arti-
ficial port. On the coast ol Campania, between Misenum and
Puteoli, there were two small lakes, the Avernus and the Lucri·
nus, separated from each other by a strip ol land about a mile in
breadth, while the latter, the outer lake, was divided from the
sea by a narrow belt of sand or shingle. 1t seems that the sea
occasionally broke through this, and that Julius Caesar accord·
ingly had it strengthened, in order that the {ish-preserves of the
Lucrine lake might not be disturbed. Agrippa now further
strengthened this barrier by lacing it with stone, but pierced it
with a channel to admit ships, and also connected the two lakes
by a canai, so as to form a sale and capacious harbour, called
the Portus Julius. Vergil (Georg. 11. ror-164) speaks ol this
work as one os the glories of Italy. But though the Lacus

. Pvemus was of great depth, the Lucrinus was buta shallow

agoon3 so that the operation was not permaneutly successful,
aud even in the time ol Strabo the harbour was practically aban·
doned. Merivale (111. 261) seems to be in error in ascribing its
abandonment to the construction of a harbour at the mouth ol
the Tiber by Octavius; lor the portur Angusti near Ostia,
