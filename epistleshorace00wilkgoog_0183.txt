ω. adnm: all Keller's MSS. hare this som not abra-
sum, which is not only badly supported but incomct, for temo
adraditur, barba abradiarr: ad rs here intensive (Roby, δ 1834,
S. G. 5 801) ‘closelyshaven’‚ but as ι man who has just beeri
shaven is closely shaven‚ we may take it, tf we please, here
as=reoens rasum with Orelli, without secking (with Yonge)
for any precise parallel. The word seems to apply to the heard
only, not, as some take it, to the head, comparing Ep. 1. 18, 7
where the connexion is quite different.

umbra, ‘booth '‚ as in Greek σκιά ior σκηνή. The booth
was empty, because the bus1er customers had been trimmed
earlier in the day; the man was sitting, ieisurely paring his own
nails, a duty. generallytundertahen by the barber (cp. Plaut.

52. non laeve=oti σκαιῶςε the adverbia} form is not found
elsewhere. Demetrius was the usual pedisequus of Philippus.

53. unde domo, ‘where he comes from’. Cp. Verg. vm.
114 mzde domo=roden οἰκόθεν. Orelli says the word is sre-
quently used in inscriptions to denote the town from which a
mancomes.

54. quove patrono: a freedman had no father, in the eyes
ot' the law, but his place was taken to a certain extent by his
patronus. In the account brought back by Demetrius the men- '¹
tion os the name Menas (a Greek name contracted from Menodo-
rus, like Hermas sor Hermodorus, Demos sor Demodorus (i) etc.
cp.v Moulton's Winer p. 128, Lightfoot on Coloss.1v.12, 15)
sufficed to show that he was a freedman3 hence no further
answer is given to this question, for Velleius must have been his
patron.

db. Volteiumr several of this gens are mentioned in history,
and the name occurs on a Pompeian inscription, No. 1782 os
the Corp. Inscr. Lat. Vol. 1v.: esse is understood, and the fol-
lowing accusatives are in apposition.

ω. praeconem: r. 65 shows that he was not an official
herald, but an auctioneer: cp. A. P. 419: Cic. de Nat. Deor.

adjective cp. Ov. Am. 1. 3, r 3 εἰπε crimine mores, Trirt. tva 10,
