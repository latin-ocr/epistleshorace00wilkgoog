1. eit (like paeon in v. 14,b1bentin v. 15, educet in v. tr,

Veliae, a town of Lucania originally founded by the
Phocaeans, when driven out ol Corsica, where they had fora
time found a home asta the destruction oi Phocaea, about
nc. 540. Its Greek name was Ὑέλη or ‘ulta It was a

sent there by his physiciaus when suffering from a troublesome
disease (Plut. Aem. c. xxxv). The soil in the neighbourhood
according to Strabo (VI. p. u 54) was poor (v. 14), and hence

ithe inhabitants lived 'largely by fisheries (v. 23). Not long

firrte te artant et tibi adsentantur, et tamdiu dum tu ades sunt
