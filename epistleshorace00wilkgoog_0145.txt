50. ooutat ‘means ⁹, ostenso used hy Cicero in his speeches‚
as well as in lighter prose and verse.

³1. stc: ie. no more than.

52. tabula being properly a plank, sometimes has picta
added, when it is used in the sense os ‘picture‘‚ as in Plaut.
Men. 144tabulam pictam in pan'ete, Ter. Eun. 584,but1nore
commonly the epithet is omitted.

fomente: evidently the parallelisrn with paintings and music
requires that this should denote something which is a source of
enjoymeut'to the healthy, but uot to the diseased. Henceany
reference to medicinal applications, such as is assumed by
Macleane, for instance, is quite out of place. Diintzer has shown
by a quotation from Seneca (de Provid. tv. 9 Quem specularia
semper ab afflatu vindisarunt, cretus pedes inter fomenta subinde
mutata tepuerunt, cuius cenationes subditus et parietibus circum·
susus conrumperent, hunc levis aura non sine periculo stringet)
that warm wrappings sor the leet, analogous to our footmuffs,
weteregarded asa luxury: but a man suffering stom the gout in
his feet would get little pleasure from them. Bentley’spodagraem
for podagram has but slight authority, and the change from the
sufferet to the disease is pleasing rather than otherwise.

54. atnoerum in the primary sense of the word ‘clean’ [the
derivation given in Lewis and Short is not quite exact: cp.
Corssen 1². 376} ΤΙιε connexion of the thought seems to be:
an unhealtlty body or mind spoils everything, just as a foul
vessel turns any contents sour. Then Horace goes outo warn
Lollius against various diseases of the mind.

rr-rl. Pleanere is not worth the pain tt brings.- greed is
never satisfied: envy is the worst of torments: anger is short-lived
madrim, and is followed by regret ‚· tt must be mastered, and that
when one is young, and trie tasle is easy», and tlte gain enduring.

⁶6. voto dat. cp. Sat. 1. r, 92, 106.

Μ. neonus never even in iambic verse has the i (cp. Plaut.
Capt. 303), but this occurs once (in cretics) in Ter. Andr. 6³8,
and in Enn. Sat. vr. p. 158 Vahl. 'Cp. Ritschl's Opusc. 11. 694
and Cic. de Orat. 111. 47, 183, which shows that illius wasa
dactyl in the ordinary pronunciation os his own time.

58. Siculi tyranni, proverbially cruel‚ especially Phalaris of
Agrigentum, the Dionysii and Agathocles at Syracuse. Cp. Cic.
in Verr. v. 56 145 tulit illa quondam insula (Sicilia) multos et
crudeles tyrannos. Juv. vr. 486 Sicula non nrr'tior aula.

n. nn: mouera u crassen naen vnn nemra vnn
