on three sides os it: the imus lectus was the couch on the left-hand
of one standing on the fourth side, and lookingtowards the table.
This couch was generally assigned to the scurrae, is there were
any in the party: in Sat 11. 8 it is occupied by the bost with a
scurra on either hand. The derisor, while flouting at others
would be servile towards the patron} Porphyrion takes it as
‘eorum den'sor qui in imo lecto accumbunt’‚ a man who jeers at
the humbler guests: but this is not likely ‘to be right. N or is
Schiitz right in taking imi laetias an attribute to alter. lt is
perhaps not necessary with Kriiger to suppose ut omitted, as in
Ep. 1, 2, 4²3 6, 63: the first man is not compared to but is a
derisor, whose place is on the lowest couch.

a curious story: cunrin Laureolo mimo [Mayor on Juv. vl11. 187]

· 1³. rixatur. The difficulty of this passage seems to meto
have been exaggerated by many commentatam, who propose, all
kinds of emendations. Keller e. g. takes objection to the asyn-
deton between rixatur and propugnat, to the obscure construction
of nugo} between propugnat and armatus, to the late Latinity
ot the construction of propugnare with the dative, and to <the
meaning ‘surinus‘ which he thinks must be attached to armatus.
None oi these seem to me serious difficulties. Asyndeton is by¹
no means unexampled in Horace ; nugis is clearly connected by
the context with propugnat ,· the construction of propugnat with
the dative is perfectly natural, ‘even if it does not actually occur
in any good writer; and armaru's here has its usual sense The
rendering ‘takes up anns and fights in desence of trifles’ is quite
legitimare and a propriate. Muretus removed the asyndeton by
reading rixator iiccepted by Keller and Kriiger), but this is not
found before Quintilian (xi. 1. 29). The vet. Bland has roratas,
for which, as Bentley also pointed out, naam would certainly
have been required. Bentley's own correction, to read caprina
tt is clumsy. ὁ Ribbeck ingeniously but needlessly reads ariaratus
