gests cessantem: ‘to bring on the sleep that is slew to come’.
But why is sleep represented as ‘slow to oome’? Acron’s
note on ad strepitum ‘quia adhibemus sonitum citharae ac lyrae·
ut facilius sopiamur' is a clear proof that he read somnum. Cp.
Cam-111. 1, ao nan avium citharaeque cannes somnum reducent.
It is a strong argument too that we need the mention of some
act, which is blameworthy, whereas to relieve one’s cares by
tttrtrrttitttrt‘tritri itiittth thret
which is an appeal against undue indulgence in sleep. Hence ,
there is much probability in Munro’s recreatum ducere somnum
(Journal oi Philology lx. 217) ‘to bring on (or to lengthen) re·
newed sleep ’. He defends this reading against the charge oi
tautology aiter v. 30 by pointing out that dominis properly 'to
lreep one’s bed ’. The argument that euram is very awkward
aiter curanda, used in a different sense, appears to me to point
rather to its being the genuine reading 3 as this awkwardness
would be more likely to strike a critic, ant >to suggest an attempt
at emendation, than to be introduced gratuitously. Cp. note on
Ep. 1. 7, 96. With Munro Ihave printed the current reading,
but with much doubt.

not only because oi the MS. evidence in its favour, but because
hominem eradere was the usual phrase ior ‘to commit murder ’ r
