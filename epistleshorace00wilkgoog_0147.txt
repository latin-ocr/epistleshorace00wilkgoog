EPIStLE 111.

The date oi this Epistle is clearly fixed hy line 1, to ac, ao.
Julius Florus, to whom it is addressed, was one of the comites oi
Tiberius Claudius in his mission to the East, when he was
sent by Augustus to place Tigranes on the throne of Armenia
in the room oi Artaxias, who had been murdered by his
own subjects (Merivale tv. 175, last ed). According to Por·
phyrio, Florus wrote satires, ‘among them some selected irom
Ennius, Lucilius and Varro ’, by which is meant doubtless that he
rewrote some ol the poems of trisse earlier authors adopting
theru¹ to the teste ot' his own day, much as Pope aad Dtyden
re·wrote Chaucers tales The amand Epistle of Book 11. is also
addressed to him-This epistle gives us a pleasant conception of
the literary tastes of the young nobles whom Tiberius had
gathered round him in his suite (cp. Ep. lx· 4), and a charming
picture os the relations os Horace, now in his 45th year, with the
younger aspirants to poetic tante, ln its tone of kindly ad·
monttton.
