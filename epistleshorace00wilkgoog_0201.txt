2. oonoinna ‘handsome'‚ apparently from the fine buildings
which adorned it, especially the famous temple of Juno: cvn-
cinnus usually carries the meaning of neatnesa aud regularity,
and therefore cannot mean (as Ritter says) grata et apta ad
habitandum. Augustus spent two winters there, nc. 31—30,
andrae. 30-29.

rogia ‘royal seat’t Sardisis nom. plur· ol Σάρδεις.

3. Zmyrna: no good MSS. give the form Smyrna, either ›
here or in Cicero (cp, de Rep. 1. 8, 13, pro Balb. 11, 28, Phil. xl.
a, 5). The views of the grammarians are discussed by Mr Ellis,
Catullus² p. 344. cp. MunroonLucret.1v. 1126.

minorave tama: a much-disputed passage. The MS. evi·
dence seems decidedly in favour of ruinamve, not minorant.
Keller warmly supports the former, reading sotira? and takes it
as a poetical equivalent for et cetera, interpreting ‘what did you
think of the other towns, whether greater or less in repute?’
eg. Ephesus, Miletus, Pergamum, etc. Munro has the same
reading, without comment. *It is not possible to translate ‘ were
they greater or less than their reputationi’ for vr is never used
in disjunctive questions, where two alternatives are contrasted.
(cases like Verg. Aen. x. 93 aut ego tela dedi, fovive Cupidine
beffa? are quite different.) lf this is to be the meaning, it is
necessary to read ininornne sonia? But it is better with Dillen·
burger to place a comma after minorave sama, translating ‘are
all, whether greater or less than their reputation, of little account
in your eyes compared with P’ etc.

4. sordent? Some editors print a comma here, instead of
beginning a fresh question with an venit: the point is not of
‘much importance, but it is perhaps betterif we read minorave,
to make the first question end at sordent. There is no gram·
matical objection to ·ne‚ on, on, introducing three alternatives.

eampo, at once the finest part of Rome, since the erection of
stately buildings there by Agrippa and others, and the scene of
its most fashionable life. ’

o. An vonit, etc. ‘or have you set your heart upon one of '
iliyiiiiriw‘ Attalus as your home?’ eg. Pergamum, Apollonia,
