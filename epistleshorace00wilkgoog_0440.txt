400 Ales? POETICA.

sto. quodcumque munitur, se ferire: Madvig (Adv.
Crit. 1. p. 68) writes ‘neque enim Horatium a. p. 350 scripsisse,

cur rs a common one 1n MSS. ⁷(cp. Madvig Emend- Lmfl,
p. 350, Roby 11. p. xxxiii). But Madvig is in error in sup·
posing that quocunque has good Ms. authority here: it ap·
pears in none os the MSS. collated by Keller or by Ritter‚ and
the only trace of it which I have been able to discover is in the
inferior Berlin cod. 269 quoted by Schiitz. Hence it is perha
better to keep to the unusual construction which is not unintellis·
gible, rather than to depart srom the Mss. mittor is a stronger
expression torpete.

it would seem at first that there is not sufficient distinction
between the sources oi error sor the strongly disjunctive r·
ticles: but lucum appears to refer to faults arising simply rom
carelessness, pamm carlito those due to the difficulties oi the
tasi, against which sufficient caredtad not been taken.

85³. nucerensis? ‘How stands the case then?’ Bentley
restored the est, which earlier editors had omitted, asserting
that quid ergo alone is used only when it is a kind of rhetorical
introduction to a following question; ‘what theut’. It is doubt·
ful whether this dictum would bear examination, except sor
Cicero. Cp. Reid on Cic. Acad. 1. 4, 13·

³54. renpcor librarius, ‘a copying clerk', a slave set to this
ernployment by his owner in order to produce boolrs either for

his own library or sor sale. Cp. Marquardt Rem. Privatalt. 1.

Ep. 1. 16, 6; 17, 1, 11.

[ei] citharoedus: Bentley read ut, which is good in itself, but
has very slight authority.

stt. muttum cessat, ‘osten neglects his duty’: Ep. ii. 1,
14. 0110111111,Ερ.11.1,131.

³58. bis terve, ‘twice‚ or even thrice’, whereas bis terque
(v. 441) is ‘twice‚ ay and thricee' the former=raro, the latter=
{crepet cp. Bentley ou Epod. v, 33‚· where he rightly restored
ts terque. Here most MSS. have bes terque, which Keller and

Schntz retain, attempting without much success to combet t

Bentley’s distinction.
