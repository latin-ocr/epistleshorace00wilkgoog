streams from a Greek source? Is Greek alone the lawiul sonn-
tain·bead oi a new vocabulary? Lehrs supposed a line to be
lost, closing witb aut si, so as to supply the missing alternative.
But Schiitz appears to interpret more correctly by ointing out
that two ways os supplying what is lacking are touched upon in

vv. 45-53: (ι) by a skilful connexion which adds new force to
current words: (a) by new words coined to express new ideas.
The second cannot be supplied from the stores ol the Latin lan·
guage‚ or this method comes to coincide with the first (as e.g.
when ‘booking’ is used to describe the purchase of railway
ticketsl: hence it must be met from the Greek. It is hardly
possible, with Orelli, to suppose that Graeca some cadere means
simply to be constructed on a Greek model, and refers to com·
pounds such as centimanus (ἑκατόγχειρος), or phrases like aurunt
vestibus illitum (χρυσόπαστος), or Cicero’s indolentia for uindicta.
Madvig's etsi (Ado. Crit. 11. 62) is attractive, but not necessary.

puto detorta ‘deducta cum parsimonia ⁵, Or. ‘a little altered
iu iorm’, i.e. moditied so as to have the form ol genuine Latin
words, like amphora from ἀμφορεύς, placenta from πλακοῦς, etc.
But this is not consistent with his interpretation oi Gracco form.
Cp. Cato as quoted by Priscian tx, p. 487 H. Marrucini vocan-
tur, de Marso detortum namen.

tt. quid autem is used in introducing a statement which
removes an objection which might have been made to a previous
statement: ‘why indeedr' ·

bt. aaut...auemntnm: ‘grant to...and reiuse to V.’: the
thought might have been more exactly expressed by datum—
adimet. Some copyists, not understanding that the reference is
to the critics oi Horace’s own time, changed dabit into dedit,
quite needlessly. These critics allowed a free use oi words
borrowed from Greek to the old dramatists3 why reiuse it to
contemporary poets? Ver 'l was attacked t'or his use oi Greek
words: cp. the quotations rom Macrobius in Conington‘s Vergil,
Vol. ι* p. xxxiii. Among the words censured are dius, daedala,
trieterica„chareas, hyalus. Cp. Cic. de Fin. 111. 4, ¹5 si Zenoni
licuit cum rem aliquam invenisset inusitatam, inauditum quaque
eirei nomen imponere, cur nan liceatCatoni ? where Cato Minor
is meant, notas Schiitz says, by an oversight, Cato Censorius.

bb. vanoque: Varius is connected with Vergil also in Ep.
11. 1, 247. Some MSS. have Varoque, as in Verg. Ecl. tx. 35
For the sreedom with which Plautus adopts Greek words in a
Latinized form cp. Sekar, Roman Poeta as the Republa'c, p. 165,
or Encycl. Brit. xlv. 33¹ b.
