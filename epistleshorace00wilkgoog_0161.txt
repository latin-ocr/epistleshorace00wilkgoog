i. e. of Gaius, the eldest son of Julia and M. Agrippa, the first
grandchild of Augustus, who was born about midsummer rac.

would equally remove the difficulty, Julius having been born on
July rath (Kal. Amit. in C. Ι. L. Vol. 1. 396). The birthday of
Augustus fell on Sept. 23 ga. d. ix. Kal. Oct), and was observed
as a holiday: cp. Suet. ct. nvn equites Romani natalem eius
sponte atque consensu biduo semper celebrarunt. No doubt the
term aestivam could be applied with strict accuracy to any night
before the autumnal equinox, though it might not seem the most
natutal epithet; but a difficulty is presented from the fact that
Horace (cp. Ep. 1. 7, 5, 16, 16) and most of his friends would
nothe likely to be in Rome at all during the unhealthy month of
September (cp. Juv. vr. 517 metuique iubet Septembris rt Austri
adventum, and Mayor on Juv. tv. 56). Meineke (followedby
Haupt and Munro) attempted to remove the difficulty by reading
festivam: but(1) if this is the genuine reading, it is impossible to
understand how it should have been retained only in one or two
quite worthless MSS-t (a) itis very clumsy, so soon after festus

poet, hut is especially suited to comedy. Hence L. Miiller
