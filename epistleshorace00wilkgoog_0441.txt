The Greek grammarians and hilosophers delighted to discover
inconsistencies and errors in omer, most of all Zoilus, known
as Ὀμηροοαστιξ. Lucilius (vv. 439-44o Lachm.) censured the
extravagance os the story of Polyphemus Ribbeck, holding
that the current text gives just the wrong meaning, reads in-

* dsguer with a mark of interrogation at Homerus, and ot idem
for et Mem. This is attractive; for the ordina reading seems
to be quite inconsistent with vv. 35r-a: i Horace is not
offended by a few saults, why should he be indignant at occa-
sional nodding? But in this somewhat loose writing Horace

ing, we ridicule him, even when to our astonishment he occa·
sionally goes right. But if he is tobe judged by a higher stand·
ard, then he must expect us to be annoyed at his slips. But
aster all he ought to, be pardoned even for them, is his task is a
long one.‘ So the vulgate may be allowed to stand.

Α. 360. opert longo: so the large majority of good MSS.
Some have opere in longo, which would have required fuit:

otherwise, though Ribbeck holds that Bentley has by no means
proved that a work can sleep.

stt. ut ctutum. The comparison os a pointing to
apicture was„ ade by Simonidess o‘ Σιμωνίδης τὴν μὲν ζωγρα-
φίαν ποίησιν σι ὦσαν προσαγορεύει, τὴν δὲ ποίησιν ζωγραφίαν
’ λαλοῦσαν (Plnt. de or. Ath. 3), repeated in ad Herenn. lv. 28,
39 poema loquens pic α, pr'cturo tacrtum poento debet esse. The
⁴misleading character o is utterance of ‘the Greek Voltaire’
Lessing has brought out ell in the ίΙοννιιίι to his Laocoon.
But here, as Orelli well points out, the reference is only to the
external aspects os the two kinds ol art, not to their points oi
internnlresemblance.· ·

ι Q! 362. abates: adr. λεη. Keller thinks that the reading
'optes of the good MS. B points to the spelling apstes.

to give plcasure. Hence no one should wrote pretty without tlte
requirite skill.
