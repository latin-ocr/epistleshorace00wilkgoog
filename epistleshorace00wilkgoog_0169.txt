18. mentae, opp. of despice. colores, ‘dyes’, i.e. vestes
purpureos.

19. loquentem, very rarely used, as the context requires that

, we should understand it here, of public speaking3 which is almost

always daero, opposed to conversational talk (loqui): cp. Cic.

Orat. 32, 113 nec idern loqui est quod dicere: de Orat. 111. 10, 38

nequeenim conamur docere eum dooere, qui loqui nesciat. So

Eupolis (Dem. 8) said of Phaeax λαλεῖν ἄριστος, ἀδυνατώτατος
λέγειν (Meineke Com. 11. 461).

20. navue. Bentley prints gnavus, which has however but
little support from the MSS. From Cicero’s words (Orat. 47, 158)
noti¹ eram, et navi et nari, quibuscum iu praeponi oporteret, dulcius
vitiem est ignoti ignavi ignari dicere quom ut veritos postulabat,
it might seem that the forms with gwere unknown to him. But
gnaruris often found in good Ciceronian Mss. and is admitted
by the best editors (eg. Halm in de Imp. Pomp. 7, 18): noras
seems nowhere to occur, nor is geroius actually found except in
the grammarians. It is very doubtful whether gnavus is from the
same root as gnaros, the meaning being entirelydifferent (Corssen
1. 83): but cp. Curt. Gr. Etym. 1.11ο. torum sor business pur·
poses, asqup.1. 19, 8, not (as Lewis and Short take it there)
for legal or political pursuits: cp. cedere foro=to become bank·

not due either to inhen'tance, or to his own energy and business

22. Mutus, probably the name of a real person, known to
Horace’s readers. Orelli remarks that Horace, though often
borrowing his types of character from Lucilius, does not limit
himself to them. Mutus is found as a cognomen ou an inscrip-

tion, quoted by Bentley, who restored the true reading for the
vulgate, Mucius, indignum.

indignum, an exclamation, as in Ov. Met. v. 37 nisi post
altorio Phineus isset, et (indignanti) scelerato profuit ora. Am.
1. 6, 1 Ianitor, indignum, duro relt'goie colena. So molum,
