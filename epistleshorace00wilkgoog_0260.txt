63. hona, ie. the lake on your sather’s estate.

tt. velox, ‘swift’ as being winged‚ in 'aocordance with the
usual representation of Nike or Victoria in works of art. There
is probably no reference. as Ritter thinks. to the rapidity with
which the battle os Actium was gained. Cp. Sat. 1. 1, 8.

· oo. utroquo pomos: ep. Plin. H. N. xxvrrr. a. ²5 polle‘ees, χ

confoveantur, premere etiam proverbio iubemur. The opposite
to this is pollicem vertere: cp. Juv. 111. 36 verso pollice volgi,
cum litet, occidunt populariter. It is not quite clear what
gesture is denoted by the two expressions. Mayor on Juv. l.c.
writes ‘those who wished the ¹death of a conquered gladiator
turned (vertebant, convertebant) their thumbs towards their
breasts, as a signal to his opponent to stab him: those who '

wished him to be spared turned their thumbs downwards ipre· ¹

mebant), as a signal lor dropping the sword'. But others take
premere as ‘to close’: so Ritter and Schera, and is I mistake
not, Georges in his lexicon (¹den Daumen einsehlagen’tr
L. and Sc have the vague phrase ‘to close down’: White ‘to
press down ³. In Prop. 111. (tv.) 10. 14 et nitidas presso pollice
{ilstttthllmnlltll ἲέῧέἷῗ ῗέἚξζ ‘tiitlt ell}
(Quint. x1. 3, 119), and from App. Met. 11. c. or (Hild.)
it is plain that this means ‘upturned': porrigit dexteram, el
adinstar oratorum confirmat articulum deabusque infimis con·
clusis digitis, ceteros eminentes porrigit, et infesto pollice cle·
rounter mbringens, infit.
