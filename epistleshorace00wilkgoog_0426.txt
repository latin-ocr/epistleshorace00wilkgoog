attempta have been made to remove the historica] inaccuracy.
Some have suggested that non ita pridem might mean ‘not long
aiter’, a notion quite without support. Others have assumed that
the referenceis only to Latin iambic verse, as written in the time
oi Horace, but thenit is not less incorrect as a historical state·
ment. Ribbeck suspects a lacuna, containing some such words
as ‘it was not long ago that [the iambus appeared in this iorm
here and there with us: but with the Greeks etclz and Schhtz
fears a serious corruption. But the difficulty is best solved by
supposing, with Orelli, that Horace is giving, not ahistorically
exact, but rather an ideal sketch ol the development of the verse,
describing its various stages as they ought to have been in theory,
rather than as he had reason to know that they had been.
Iambic lines ought to have been originally pure, and afterwards
to have admitted spondees Mr Reid ingeniously suggests that
we should read non ita: pridem etc.. ‘Not so: long ago' as in
Verg. Aen. 11. 583. But there a question precedes.

to miss the aliortive tone ol the whole passage, in which the
iambus is made to give orders, to welcome, to be obliging and
long-suffering, and to act in friendly iashion. Α t‘oot that can
do all this, may surely be allowed ‘hereditary rights '.-Horace
omits to mention the last place, to which os course the iambus
also held tenaciously. Peerlkamp has thought it necessary to
remedy this omission, by reading sextove, sed for socrirlittr.
This last word is another of the ἅπαξ λεγόμενα which are so
common in this Epistle. It means ‘admitting into partner·
ship’. Perhaps a comma should be placed at ouria, so that
aon...quarta may be parenthetical.

adverb. nobilibus ‘famous', here ironical. Horace means that
,the iambus appeared so rarely that they were hardly deserving
to be called iambic trimeters; in some oi the extant fragments
there are lines which consist wholly oi spondees, with the excep·
tion oi the last foot. But L. Miiller Ennius p. 243 denies that
this censure is on the whole justified.
