¹144 HORATI EPISTULAE.·

71 sim crimine coniunx, Cic. de Orat. 1. 23, 105 loquacitatem
sine usu (note).

notum properare ‘well known sor working with energy’z
for the construction cp. Sil. Ital. ΧΗ. 330 Delius avertet pra
picra pericula vates Trotiznos notus semper minuisse labores.
' This is an instance of Horaee's free use of the infinitive (cp.
Ritter on Cann. 1. 1, 18 or Wickham's Appendix 11.) and is
better than Orelli's interpretation, which places a comma after
uotum and takes it absolutely. Bentley inclines, though with
doubt, to the reading sine crimine natum, but, besides having
very slight MS. support, this is ill suited to a sreedman sine
patra—loeo ‘at the right time ’‚ not quite (as Yonge) ὅταν τύχῃ,
Eut rathgr ἐᾶκξιρῷὲ Cp. Cann. 1v.1o, 28, Ter. Ad. 216, Roby

1172, . . 48.

cessare ‘taking holiday’: cessare otiari et iumndc vivere
Comm. Cruq. Ep. 1. ro, 46,11. a, 183 &o

68. parvis ‘humble' like himselfi-lure nerto ‘ahouse of
hisown’3 he is not like Maenius in Ep. 1. 15. 28. Bentley’s
suggestion curto would be redundant aster tenui censu.

69. ludis: sc. scaenicis et circensibus: these were held only
on days ol general holiday, so the limitation post decisa negatio
is not needed in this case.

campo, sc. Martio: Carrn. 1. 8, 4, Sat. 11. 6, 49, Ep. Ι.
11, 4. T he usual time sor exercise in the campus was the eighth
hour: the amusements there practised were running, jumping,
wrestling, boxing, spearthrowing, riding, swimming iu the
Tiber, and hall-playing.

60. adteri, a good instance os the reflerive deponent ‘to
make myself informed ², Roby, 5734, 1419: the word is not
used in guod prose.

⁶1. non eune=od niun, but in both cases the question has
been raised whether the negative is strengthened or weakened
by the added particle. The former seems to be the case: cp.
Cope’s Gorgias App. ii., Cic. de Orat. 112 1, 5 (note), de Off.
11. a, 5lzaudsane intellego: Ep. 11. ι, 106, Sat. -11. 3, 138. Hence
we must reject Orelli's vix as an equivalent.

62. benigne: cp. v. 16.

. 6³. negot, ‘is he to resuse mel’ Roby S. G. ἕ 674.
mprobus ‘the impudent fellow'‚ from the point of view of
Demetrius. We need not, with Orelli, try to weaken the force

‘pf the epithot by referring to our colloquial use of words like
wretch ‚ or ‘rascal'.

⁶4· ‚meua ‘next morning ’.
