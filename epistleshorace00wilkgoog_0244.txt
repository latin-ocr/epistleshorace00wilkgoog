²04 HORATI EPISTULAE.

2453 the story is told by Diog. Laert. 11. 8, 68 παριόντᾳ ποτὲ
error (Ἂρίστιππον) λάχανα πλύνων Διογένης ἔσκωψε καὶ φησιν,

el ταῦτα ἔμαθες προσφέρεσθαι, οὐκ ἅν τυράννων αὐλὰν ἐθεράπευες. ’
ὁ δὲ καὶ σύ, εἶπεν, εἰπερ ᾔδεις ἀνθρώποις ὁμιλεῖν, οὐκ ἂν λάχανα ·
ἔπλυνες. patienter ‘contentedly'. mbas, the words of Diog. ἢ

Laert. show that we need not take this in the more general
meaning os ‘the wealthy'‚ as in Sat. 1. ν, 86: the reference is in
the first placeto Dionysius the elder, at whose court Aristippus
spent some time (Lucian Paras. 3 3). Orelli thinks that prandere

rs used instead of cenare here, because holus was better suited to ’

the light daffcrlner than to the more substantial dinner; bnt ep.
Ep. 11. a, 168 emptum cenat lrolus, os one who iscertainly not

poor. Besides it would weaken the point to say ‘if you could =

make your ligkter meal off vegetables'r ii the difference is to be
pressed, surely the main meal of the day ought to have been
mentioned. Ritter rather daringly suggests that the Greek is
incorrectly recorded by Diog. Laert. and that a pun may have
been intended: el ἅρισπῴη Ἀρίστιππος λάχανα κ.τ.λ. But the

nor. ind. is the right tense, not the pres. opt. Hence we must κ

be content with supposin that Aristippus passed Diogenes in
the moming‚ when the latter was washing vegetables lor his
prandium. The modern Italian prandio or pranzois ‘dinner’
ps ρρροεὲἁ to ‘olazgmffal-bmksastl' but the word seems never
0 euse sorngoo ιιι. ’

14. strunt reclhus uti: Orelli reminds us oi the sayingol ³

to. utrius: Horace has illlus always with the exception of

Sat. 1. ιο, 67, and so alredus, urrtus, utriusque, ullius, unlus ¹

(but unius in Canu. lv. 9, 390, nulllus (hut nullius in v. ον, and
ppOIpep, 14). For Cicero’s practice cp. De Orat. 111. 47,183

ra. aaroni ‘pantenu the reading ιιιιιιιιι has nuc
1alpglcrlppitryy andis unsuited to the passage, in which there is no

1⁹. mthl ’ῐοιιιιγ own profit’. troo ‘this conduct of mine’,
not referring to the latter os the two altematives, bnt to that
which is nearer to the thought of the speaker. Cp. Sat. 11. ν,

29.

20. equus utme portet: Bentley first‘showed clearly that
this goes with offin'umsacio, not as previous editors had taken it
with est. *The phrase ivas a proverbial one in Greek: ἵπποςμε

, φέρει, βασιλεύς με τρέψειε cp. Diogen. Paroem. v. 31, where it
¹ is explained as the answer oi a certain Corraeus in service under

Philip, when his mother begged hini to ask tor his discharge„
