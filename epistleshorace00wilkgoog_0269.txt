. 8-9. forum-severia. Cp. Catull. v. a rumoresque senum
severorum. The question into whose mouth Horace puts these'
words' depends upon the reading in v. ro. The old reading
aaa has been again defended by Schiitz, who argues that
Liber is to be taken as the subject. , ‘The knowledge of Roman
conditione cannot surprise us in a God‚ especially as he is in·
troduced under his Latin name3 and to lay stress upon the
anachronism destroys the jesting tone of the passage’. But
even if we allow this, the whole context shows that Horace is
ridiculing his own slavish imitatore, not the poets who fell in
with the ordinance of their patron deity. Bentley rightly saw that
pallerem in v. 18 made this quite clear. The attempts that have
been made to hud a subject in Cratinus or Ennius are still less
successful. The puteal Libonis-a low circulor wall built round

Libo, possibly the aedile of ac. 193, but more probably the trib. pl.
of lac. 149-was certainly not known to Cratinus, and probably
not to Ennius Hence it is much better to accept the reading
edrici, which has good MS. authority. The word is used with a
certain mock solemnity ‘I laid down this law’‚ as in Sat. 11. a, 513
3, 227, with a reference to thepraetor’s edict. Perhaps it is
better with Bentley to suppose that Horace had expressed this
opinion ‘inter convictores than topress pass es like Carm. 1.

The Scholiasts here and on Sat. 11. 6, 35 tell us that the ³
praetor's tribunal was set up at the puteal Libonis: but Mr Palmer
rightly points out that in neith'er of these passages, nor yet in
Pers. ιν. 49 (where cp. Conington’s note) is there any reference
to legal business. It is better to take it simply as ‘the Exchange',
where business meu, and especially money-leaders meet. Cp.
Cic, pro Sest. ⁴8, 18 alter..pateoli ct foeneratorum gregibus
inflatus. The question. whether there were not two or even
more puteals iu the Forum is one not easy to decide: cp. Dict.

representation of the p. libonisl: Bum's Rome ond tlte Cam-

gna p. 86: Nichol’s Roman Famam p. 1²9· If however‘the
Scholiasts here and on Pers. tv, 49 are right in say'rng that the
p. Libonis was near the F abian arch, it cau hardly have been
identical with the puteal of Attus Navius in the Comitium (Cic.
