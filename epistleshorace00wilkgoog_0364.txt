This passage is rather against the notion of Lachmann on
Lucret. ν. 1203 that' pacare there refers to the expulsion of
wild beasts. flammis: ‘Palladius directs that when landis
covered with trees, a distinction must be made between that
which is naturally good an'd that which is poor, as from the
former the timber should be merely removed, aad the land
ploughed up (vomcrc=iarro): whereas in the latter it should be
burned, in order that the soil may be enriched with the ashes

Horace tells us (Sat. 1. 6, 114) that he was fond of standing by
, the astrologers in the Circus, and listening to their predictions,
without any great saith in them: in Carm. 11. 17, 17-aa he
uses the language of astrology merely as poetical ornament, aad
in a manner which shows his own indifference to it; in Cann.
r. 11 he condemns it as an idle superstition. Persius, as usual,
imitates the language of Horace, and like him does not profess
to know what his own horoscope is (v. 45-51). Alter the time
of Horace, astrology received a considerable impulse at Rome
from the patron e of Tiberius: cp. Tac. Ann. 11. 27, ας 32, 53
