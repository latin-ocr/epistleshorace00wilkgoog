Arritoflc's Rhetoric p. 282 (note) writes ’κύριον (ὄνομα) is the
“proper ¹¹ word by which any object is designated, and [which is]
commonly em loyed to denote it. It is therefore opposed to all
the other kin s of words: to all figurative, foreign, archam, or
in any way “uncommon'' words...any words which strike us as
strange or unusual’. Cicero de Orat. 111. 37, 149 contrasts
propria verba with metaphorica] (quae tranffonntur) and newly

introduced or coined (quac novantur effecimus ipsa) expressions. ’

Cp. Orator 24, 80, Quint. v111. 3, 24 (propino, ficta, translata)
Arist. Rhet. 111. a, a.

· nomtna...verba: ίνὸματα...ρήματα, ‘nouns and verbs’ covered
with Plato the whole of language [cp. Cratyl. 4318 loyor γάρ
που, ὦς ἐγῷμαι,ὴ τούτων [ῥημάτων καί ὀνομάτων] ξύνθεσίς ἐστινε
cp. 4²5 a): and though Aristotle added the σύνδεσμος and the
Stoics completed the ‘parts of speech’. the names of the two
chief classes were often used in the same wide sense, as here.
Cp. Sat 1. 3, 103 donec verba quibus vocer sensusque notarent,
nominaque invenere. But cp. Palmer there.

235. satyrorum scriptor, ie. if 1 were to write satyrio
dramas: the Greek critics denote these sometimes by the word
οάτυροιε eg. Demetr. de Eloc. 169 (Rhet. Gr.1x.76Walz)
οὐ γὰρ ἐπινοήσειεν ἅν τις τραγῳδίαν παίζουσαν, ἐπεί σάτυρον
γραφει ἀντί τραγῳδίας. Horace means to say that he would not

confine himself strictly to the plainest language‚ and avoid so

completely the elevated tone o tragedy as to reduce his serni-
divine characters to the level of slaves in comedy.

23⁶. afflans with dat. as in Sat. 1. 4, 48 nisi quod pede certo
di ert sermoni, samo merres: cp. v. 1523 Ep. 11. 2,193:oolort

p. 1. 17, 23.

237. Davus, a common slave's name, said to be from Arios, a
Dacian, the older name of this tribe having been Δοῖοι, according
to Strabo vn. 304. The name occurs in the Andria of Terence;
-Forcellini and the dictionaries based on Freund say also in
Plautus, but this is an error: no characterio Plautus bears the
name3 it occurs only in Amphitr. 361 as a jest. Cp. Sat. 1. ro,
40, and 11. 5, 91 where the name is typical, as here, and 11. 7, a
where it is ascribed to a slave belonging to Horace.

et audax: a striking instance of the value of the vet. Bland.
and the oldest Berne MS. when in agreement. These (and
the Munich ΜΒ. C, which comes from the same source as the
Beme MS.) alone have et: all other MSS. have the evidently

erroneous an.

2³8. Pythias, not the amilla in the Eunuchus of Terence,
but according to Acrona girl in a comedy of Lucilius, who
cheated her master out of a talent. As Lucilius is not known
