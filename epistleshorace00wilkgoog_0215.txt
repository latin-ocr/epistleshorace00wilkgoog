Horace wishes to indicate that his estat,e though small, rs no
contemptible one, and it is more to the purpose to refer to its
present tenants than to its past occupiers. The eight operae
doubtless tilled the ‘Whomeiarm under the vilicus. The patres
were probably free coloni (Carm 1 35, 6 pauper ruris colonus:
11. 14, 12 sive inopes erimus coloni), who tilled the rest os the
estate, paying to Horace as the dominus either a fixed rent, or
as so osten now in Italy, a portion of the produce. In the
former case they would be said od pecuniam reetmerotom con·
ducere, in the latter they were called partimi, i. e. metayers. ,
Cp. Dig. xrx. 2, 25, ἕ 6. Others, less plausihly, suppose thern
to have been free hired labourers, under the direction of the
oilicrar. Sir T. Martin, for instance (Lis e ot' Horace, p lxxiv),
says ‘the larm gave employment to five families of lrlee col'‚one
who were under the superintendence os a hailiff: and the poet s
domestic establishment was composed os eight slaves'. His
version is inconsistent with this view, but not, I think, less rn-
correct: -

‘That small domuin which, though you hold it cheap,
Sufficed oi old five samilies to keep,
And into Varia sent, in days gone by,
Five worthy heads of houses’,

Conington’ s rendering,

‘Which thoughy e snrff at it, could once support
Five hearths anyd send five statesmen to the court’
