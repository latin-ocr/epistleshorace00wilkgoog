Licinus was a barber, who was made a senator by Caesar because
of his enmity to Pompeius. There was a Licinus who was a
Gaul, taken prisoner by Caesar, and made his desponsator: he
was afterwards emancipated and high in favour with Augustus,
who made him procurator of Gaul in B.c. 16· and 15. There he
acquired great wealth, which became proverbial: cp. Pers 11. 36,
Juv. 1. 109 ogo possideo plus Pallante et Licinis (with Mayor's
note); xlv. 305 proraiam Licinus: Seu. Ep. exre. ao quorum

proposes, would have been more usual; but it is only found in
two uuimportant MSS. Cp. Seneca quoted by Roby θ 1683
numnam, inquit Cornelio, nonfelr'crm me disum, quae Gracchos
peperi. The verb is here used strictly in a middle sense, like .
