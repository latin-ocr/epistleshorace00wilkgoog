the tabulata or tiers of branches by removlng intermediate
boughs and superfluous twigs. ‘The trees were planted iu rows,
forty feet asunden ir the land between them was tilled lor corn
. (as was usually the case), otherwise twenty leet3 the distance
between the trees iu the row was to be twenty leet. The trees
as they grew were to be pruned‚ so that the first seven or eight
ieet oi their stem might be free from branches. Above that
height the branches on each side were to be formed into tabulata
or stodes, three ieet munder, and notin the same plane, on
which the vines might be trained. The vine was to be planted a
t'oot and a half from the tree. Colum. ν. 7, de Arb. 16, Plin.

notice that Mena worked his ox to death in trying to make up
sor his losses is a little farfetched: it is simpler to suppose that
the soil os the ferni was stony. - ·
