³6. non cuivis etc. ‘it is not the lot ol every one to be
able to visit Corinth': i.e. every one has not the means to
indulge in the pleasures provided so. abundantly, but at so high
e price, at Corinth. According to the testimony of Gellius
(1. 8, 4), Strabo (v111. 6, ao), the scholiasts here, and the Greek
'paroemmgraplri the proverb orl παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἐς Κόρινθον ἔσθό’
πλοῦς originated in the exorbitant demands made by Lais and
other notorious courtesans of the place, on those who sought
their favours. But the context shows that this origin had been
almost it not entirely sorgotten, or Horace could not have used
it thus os the prizes due to preeminent virtue. ¹Still less can
there be any reference, as Erasmus after Suidas thought, to the
dangerous entrance to the harbour. The old notion that eon·
tingere was only used of good fortune has long been discarded.

(Holden). Mr Reid thinks however that the contrast with
pervenit requires that sedit should have rather the meaning
‘takes a low place’: a force common enough in the literal sense,
as in Lucret. v. 474 depressa sederent. The perfects are
‘gnomic ¹, as in Ep. 1. a, 48 (note), A.P. 343.

the subject, but apparently never like our ‘succeed‘ with a
