Corum Cnrq. The derivation which he suggests is of course
absurda laima is for loc-ma (cpiam for luc-no, extimeo for
cotug-men, riorus· for Iri-'musy while Ldmia (A. P. 340) :Adara
is akin to Λαμυρός ‘greedy. From the fact that the word is
found nowhere else (except in Festus) until it reappears in the
Romance lauguages (cp. Diez Romame Dictionory (ed. Donldn)
p. 266; and Dante lnf. xx. 99 non molto Iro corso, cherma uno
lama), it seems to have belonged to the popular dialect. ’ ‘Push
on stoutly over hills, streams and bogs.’ If Horace is really
referring to the road between his Sabine estate and Rome, these
words are a ludicrous exaggeration‚ hardly to be defended by the
plea that the expression may have been proverbial.

14. glomus has the support of the best MSS. Glomos,
though the usual reading before Bentley, has but slight support,
and is not Latin: globos has still less. Lucret. 1. 360 has in
lonae glomere, but the derivatives are always glomero etc. ⁴

eruta or the corrupted Pirria is the reading of all MSS.
collated by Keller. Most editors have adopted the form barthio,
but as Lachmann (on Lucret. p. 408) first remarked ‘neque
Graecas neque Romanaefeminae nomm est’. Macleane explains
it as ‘formed from Pyrrha, the name of a town in Lesbos, like
Lesbia, Delia ete! But the adjective from Pyrrha is &inhias 1
(Ov. Her. xv. 15), while Lesbius, Delius, uc„ are common.

play by Titinius, who stole a' hall of wool, but being drunlr
at the time, carried it so clumsily that she was easily detected.
As Titinius wrote cooroedaire togatae it is probable that the girl
, was an Italian, in which case her name may well have been
Poma, the form found in the MSS. being then a corruption
like Sylla for Sulla. Porphyrion actually has Puro-ia, and P·
Purrer'us is found on an inscription. L. Miiller, Meineke and
others simply mark the word as corrupt.
