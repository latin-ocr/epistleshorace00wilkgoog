apodosis is also in the subjunctive, which makes the sentence a
pure hypothesis.

444. maurane: v. 358·

441. tornatos: Bentley argues at great length that though
the auvil and the lathe can each be metaphorically applied to
verses, they cannot be applied at the same time, aud also that
tarentus like limatus could only be used of something properly
, finisbed‚ so that it admits os no adverb. He suggests ter natos (a
mostunluckyconjecture),‘iftheyhavethricecomeoutbadverses’‚

finishing tool has been thrice applied widiout success‚the mis·
shapen thing must be placed upon the anvil and hammered up, so
that a new start may be made; but not (as Orelli thinks) with a
new lump of mered, which is against reddere. Some editors have
adopted ,the conjecture formatos, which is weak. Cp. Ovid

< Trist. 1. 7, 49 ablatum mediis opus est incudibus illud (sc. Meta·

morphoses)‚ defuit et scriptis ultimalimo meis: Propert. 111. 32,
43 incipe riom angresto versus includere torno. ἁποτορνεύειν is

< common in the same sense. ,

x 444. νοήσω ‘to change’ (Ep. r 45, 39) withaslight zeugma,
deltam being the faulty line. is isbetter than to say with
Orelli that there is a reference to the phrase stilum vertere, or
with Scb'utz, that it is for avertere ‘to remove it ’.

wrong with a staring black mark’ (Con).

447. dnum, the obelus —, which was made with a cross
stroke of the pen, to signisy condemnation: cp. Lucian Χῖ.. apd
τὰ νόθα ἐπισημηνάμενος των laide ἐν τῇ παραγραφῇ τῶν ὀβελων.
Α χ was similarly used, and that may perhaps be rather intended
here; botone Ms. bas obelum as a gloss.

mavorte cannot be the same as verso, as some take it.
