Cicero, and then with an apology: cp. de Leg. 1. 16, 45 prudens,
et, ut ita datam, cattos. Horace has it in Carm. 111. η, ιο, catus
roculooa'. Cp. Reid on Cic. Acad. 11. 30, 97.

40. zonam: for the custom of carrying money iu a beltc .
the passage from a speech by Gaius Gracchus, preserved in Geli
xv. ra, cum Romam profectus sura, mnas, quas plenas argenti
extuli, eas ex provincio inanes rettuli. This practice does not
seem to be mentioned in classical Greek [Xen. Anab. 1.
quoted by Mr Yonge is not an instance]: but cp. Matth. inp,

μη κτήσησθε χρυσὸν μηδὲ ἄργυρον μηδὲ χαλκὸν εἰςτὰς ζώνας bauo. ,

42. Achilles: cp. Quint 1. 8, 5 optime institutum estut ab
Homero atque Vergilio lectio inciperet: Plin. Ep. 11. 14, a in foro
pueros a centumviralibus causis auspicari ut ab Homero in scholis.

43. bonae agreeing with Athenae ‘kind’, almost equivalent
to mbo below. Others, not so well, connect the word with

. 44. vellem: the MSS. vary here between vellem, possim, and

possem: but Keller seems to be right in saying that the first has
the most authority, while the last (though preferred by many
good recent editors) has the least. With vellem, ut must be talren
as consecutive ‘so that it was my desire', ie. ‘and inspired me
with the wish’t with possent, at would probably be final ‘that it
might be in my power '.

’ motum carries with it the mathematica] sense oia ‘right'
line, as well as the moral sense, and hence is opposed to curvus:
so pravior originally means ‘croolred’, and our ‘wrong’ is what
is ‘wrung’ aside or perverted. Skeat quotes from Wyclif ‘wrung
nose’ ior ‘crooked nose’. Persius IV. 12 again imitates Horace:
rectum discernis, ubi inter curva subit, vel cum fallit pede regula
varo.

th dpknoscere, retained by many editors, is quite without au·
