88. puden! prava ‘srom a false shame ’.

90. puratis, i.e. suited to daily life: a shocking traged in
the life of a king ought not to be described in verse suit to
rh'e ordinary affairs of a simple citizen.

φῇ This line has been transposed to after v. 98 by 1. Miiller,
and rejected by Lehrs and Ribbeck. Certainly it rather breaks
the connexion of the thought, and could well be* spared, but it
may be defended as a generalising remark introduced by Horace,
to bear out what he said in v. 86: quaeque then refers not to
tragedy aud comedy, which is hardly possible grammatically
(though occasionally quisque is used where uterque would be
mor'e correct),but toall kinds of poetry. decentem is the reading
of the Bland. vet. aad the excellent Beme MS. restored by
Bentley, and adopted by the best editors since. The construction
then is ringula sunm quaeque lacerna teneant, (quantam) sortita
(sunt lacum) decentem. Schiite and Keller defend decenter, conf
nectirg it with teneant.

93. atoomoadla ‘eren comedy', aswellas tragidy, ’

94. mmor, a name borne by old men in the Andria, >

Phormio, Hautontimorumenus of Terence, and by a young man
in the Eunuchus. The reference here is probably to the severe
language of Chremes in Haut. v. 4. Horace uses the word of
a miser in Epod. 1. 33, borrowing it from some unknown
comedy. Perhaps the name was applied to old men from a
belief in the absurd old etymology ‘a χρέμπτεσθαι screare, quia
senes screare solent ’. It is really connected with ypra-tyn ‘to
snort’, and grim etc. (Fick, Wtb. 1. 582, Curt. Gr. Et. 1. a5o):
the Chremes of the Eunuchus is an ‘adulescens rusticus ’.
