Aristius Fuscus was an intimate friend oi Horace, addressed
by him in Canu. 1. nr, and mentioned also in Sat. 1. 9, 613 so,
83, in the former case as playing a mischievous joke upon him,
in the latter among other friends as optim. Some MSS. here
have the heading Ad Aristium Fuscum Grammaticum‚ and
Acron on Sat. 1. ·9‚ 61 says ln‘e fuit grammaticus illius lempcm's
doctissimus.- here he says he was a writer oi tragedies, while
Porphyrion calls him a writes of comedies. There is mention
also of Aristii Fusci grammatici liber ad Asinium Pollionem (cp.
Orelli ad Sat. 1. 1.). Itis clear that he was a literary man, and
from this epistle it appears that he did not share Horace’s love
for the country and its pursnits. There is nothing to determine
the date os thss epistic, hut it may well come within the limits
assigned to the others in this book, i. e. between ae. ae and
