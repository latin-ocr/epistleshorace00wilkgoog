Bk Ι. Ep. Vk] NOTES. ‚¹²5

amaru ‘guests whom you may bring’: the umbrae were
guests not invited by the host, but brought by an invited guest,
as Maecenas brought Vibidius and Balatro to the dinner given
by Nasidienus (Sat. 11. 8, aa). Conington’s rendering ‘and
each might bring a friend or two as well’ is misleading: the
number of unumne could not be more than four, if the party was
not to exceed the approved limit of nine, three on each couch ε be·
sides the remark was only addressed to Torquatus, not to the
others.

29. premunt ‘annoy'. eanimurum: caperis similarly
used by Catull. LXIX. 5, LXXI, 1, and by Ov. A. A. 111. 193:
the feminine form only here, though certainly not, as Orelli sup·
poses from any feeling of delicacy‚ which however desirable ac·
cording to our notions, is not likely to have occurred to Horace.

’ 30. motus esse velia, ‘how large you would like the party to
be’: ‘name your number’ (Con.): cp. Mart. xtv. 217 dic quotus
et quanti cuprius cenare. Quotus asks a question, the answer to
which is to be given by an ordinal: hence we may compare ffle
Greek phrase ᾑρέθη πρεσβεὺτης δέκατος av’rds: lhave found no
exact parallel in Latin, but ‘how many days ago l‘ (quotus iam
dns) aiiswered by tertius zum dr'es est, is somewhat analogous.
Cp.Ep.11. 1, 35.

³1. nostloo ‘the back-door’ such as has been found in many
Pompeian houses. Senec. de Brev. vit. 14, 4 says quam multi
per resarum clientibus atrium prodire 'vitabunt et pur obscuros
aedium adituspnffugr'ent.-ialle ‘give the slip to ’.

EPISTLE VI.

Nothing is known of the Numicius, to whom this Epistle
is addressed‚ and his name is only introduced to keep up the
epistolary form, for nothing turns upon it. Nor is there any hint ,
to assist usin determining the date ι it may have been written at
any time within the limits between which Horace seems to have
practised this style of composition. The general purpose of the
Epistle is to recommend a philosophie calm as the true way of¹
regarding the various objects of human desire: But from v. 31,
to me end Horace adopts a tone of strong irony, urging Nu·
micius, if he will not accept this theory of life, to pursue with
resolute energy whatever end he may choose to propose to

himself.
