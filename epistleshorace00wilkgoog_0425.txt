‘Because of this rapid character it (the iambus) bade* the name

‘trimeter' attach itself to the iambic lines, although, etc.' For
the very common attraction of trimetris into the case of tambeis,

describing three stages in the history of the iambic line z (ι) when,
as with the iambographers, the line usually, though not always
consisted of pure iambi v. 254: (a) when, asin the Greek
dramatists, the pace was moderated, and spondeos might be
found in the first, third and fifth places v. 255: (3) when, as in
the Roman dramatists, spondees were sometimes found in' every
foot but the last. He interprets them ‘Hence even to the
iambic verses (ἰαμβεῖα) of the iambographers which are to be

, measured as trimeters, has the iambus so to say done violence,

by forcing upon it a quickened pace in excess of its natural
rapidity, by repeating six times the same foot’. Momm, con·
tracted sor monimen is either that which causes motion, or that
which is moved, or simply motion. The word is fairly common
in Lucretius, eg. vr. 474 esolro momine ponti, and was else-
where restored by Scaliger by a tolerably certain conjecture sor
atamen: e.g. Manil. 1. 34 meminitque et cursus signorum, Aetna

note. This conjecture and the interpretation therewith con·
nected were accepted by Keller in his editio minor of 1878,
but in the Epilegomena (1880) he returns to the MS. text.
Kriiger ¹⁰ (Anhang p. 384) also approves Schiitz ou the other
hand rejects it: and I think rightly. The point to be explained
is why a verse consisting of six feet should be called a trimeter
verse: and Ribbeck's conjecture goes no way towards explaining

this. Nor is it easy to see to what previous stage of the verse ,

the iambus added a quickened pace, even if we assume, which
is far from certain, that a line with six beats in it is more rapid
than one with three. Finally the more frequent occurrence of
pure iambic lines in writers like Archilochus, Simonides of
Amorgos and Hipponax, is by no means established by their
extant fragments: it rests solely on the testimony of gram·
marians, which perhaps means no more than this, that the
iambographer sometimes wrote poems in pure iambics, as we
know was done by Catullus (iv. xxiv.) and Horace.

lta pridem These words present a very grave difficulty, for in
the earliest iambics known, written 600 years before this time,
spondeos are found frequently in the uneven places· Cp. Archil.
