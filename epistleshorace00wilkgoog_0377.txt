aud Schiitz reject this interpretation, preferring to translate
‘reasonable ⁹, asin aequum tus etc. But ‘a reasonable power of
unlimited licence‘ is a contradiction in terms, not to be defended
by saying that quidlibet isan intentional exaggeration, corrected

who could paint nothing but a cypress. A shipwrecked man
requested hrm to paint a picture of his disaster, that he might,
according to the custom, carry it about, and get alins (J uv. xrv.
