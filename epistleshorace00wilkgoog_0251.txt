Bk1.Ep.xvn1.]NOTES.· ·. 211

hard to suppose that there would have been no reference in
vv. 5 5—57 to the fact that Tiberius wes in the East at the same
time as Augustus. Resides, the elder Lollius was a bitter enemy
of Tiberius (Suet. Tib. xl1.; Tac. Ann. 111. 48). Ritter thinks
that the epithets venerandus (v. 73) and potens (v. 86) prove that
it must have been some member of the im rial house, and that
, Tiberius and Agrippa 'are both excluded y the fact that they
were absent at this time from Rome, while Augustus is plainly
not intended: hence he assumes that Claudius Drusus, the younger

brother of Tiberius, at this time 18 years of age, must be referred

to. It is better to leave the question undetermined.

The tone‘of the epistle hasbeen severely censured by some ⁵

editors: eg. by Macleane. But the key to it seems to be found
in the epithet liberrime of v. r. This means more than ‘of an
ingenuous disposition ', as Macleane renders it. Taken iu con·
nexion with v. 5 ff, it plainly denotes an outspoken srankness in
danger of passing into offensive rudeness. Horace blames in the
tnost explicit language all unworthy servility‚ and points out the
dangers and vexations of a court-life very frankly. But seeing
that his young friend is emberked upon it, he gives him the
advice which his temperament seemed most to require. That a
man who is thrown into the society of one superior to himself in
sociat station should not offend him by persistently obtruding his

own opinions on matters of trifling importance, by displaying his ·

own vices and follies, by prying into secrets, and betraying thern,
by finding fault with his friend's tastes and pursuits, by incon-
tinent loquacity, and by introducing to him unworthy acquain-
ῐαῐὲὲῗᾶ is suirleily nothing ‘very degrading ’ and islar removed from
re serv ty.

struction is doubtful: some understanding se (in which case it
would be parallel to ‘this passage), others te, others again tibi.
Cp. Page, Ritter (or Schtitz)‚ und Wickham ad loc. Perhaps
however we may take ame'erem as directly governed by professus,
like agere amicum, neentiri iuvenem (Mart. 111. 43, 1).

8. mommo: the long vowel in the second syllable is very Ι
rare: but this passage shows that Roby 1. 94 (note), S. G. p. 16
(note) is not right in saying that it is never found.

4. discolor: prostitutes were required to wear udark toga,
women divorced for adultery a white one, while matrons of good
character wore the white stola (Comm. Cruq. on Sat.1.2‚63;
