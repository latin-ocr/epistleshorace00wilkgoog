EPISTLE vm.

This Epistle was written in Β. c. ao, and is addressed to the
Celsus Albinovanus who is mentioned in Ep. 1. 3, 15 as one
of the suite accompanying Tiberius in his expedition to Armenia.
It may possibly have been sent at the same tirne as Ep. 111.
The tone is curiously sels-reproachsul3 it is not likely to have
been adopted by Horace simply in order to relieve his own
feelingsr such a view would be inconsistent with the relations
which seem to have existed between Horace and Celsus, who
was probably young enough to have been his son. It is more
likely assumed to prepare lor, and at the sarne time to sosten, the
kindly warning to a friend whose pride in his advanccment at
court seemed to require a check.

by ewaldus sirty years before this in the civil wars,(Appion‚
tac. 1. 62), and by a M. Tullius contemporary with Crcero
