Satires: in this very Epistle (v. nso) it evidently includes the
Epistles. Hence if, ns we shall see reason to believe, the second
and third Epistle of this book (the latter the s0·called Are
Portica) were written before the first, they may well have been
the Sermones mentioned by Suetonius. The answer to the
second is that Horace himself in v. 4 apologisesfor the brevity of
this poem, aad the sportive protest of Augustus is a reply to
this apology. Hence there is no valid reason for rejecting the
thietmer} p lntlln illidi (ῗέῗὲ {5}an
quidam, and that, though they must, as he admits, have been
published some time previously, the slightness of the acquaint-
ance between Horace and the Emperor before the publication of
me Carmen Saeculere prevented the latter from having any
knowledge of them. It seems to me very doubtful whether
Mommsen is right in limiting the intimacy of Augustus with
Horace so completely to the last few years of his lif . .

This Epistle has always been a favourite one. It contains a
great deal of shrewd criticism with some of those happy auto·
biographical touches‚ which Horace knew so well how to throw
in. Mommsen indeed (Hermes xv. 103) calls these three
Epistles ‘the most graeeful and delightful works in all Roman

literature '.

1-4. With all the claime repon your time, Caesar, I should
be unpatrietic, rfI were to address' you at length.

1. edne: Augustus did not lose the support of Agrippa
until tac. ro, but since nc. 17 he had been in the East, return·
ing to Rome this year, about the same time as Augustus re·
turned from Gaul. But Horace is speaking of the responsibility
of empire; and with a natural license.

2' moribus. The position which Augustus assumed as a
‘saviour of society' and reformer of morals is often dwelt upon
by the poets ol hi‘s time, and is admirablp described by M. Gaston
Boissierin his RelzgianRemaius, vol. 1. 7-108. Cp. Mommsen,
Staatsr. 11². 686 note 1. With moribus the scholiast rightly sup·
plies suis not tuis: for· the combination of mares and leges
cp. Carnt. 111. 24, 3 5 quid‘leges sine maribus vanaeproficiunt?

4. morer fua. tempora ‘waste your time’: just as we have
in Ep. 1. 13, 17 oculos auresque neoeari, ‘to make eyes and ears
dwell upon a thing’, so here the tempora, the time theh
Augustus had at his command sor important business, is repre·
sented asin danger of being taken up with Horace’s poetry.
The plural tempore in prose always seems to carry with it some·
thing of the force of καιροί ‘opportunities’ for doing anything‚
not merely the lapse of time: thus often=‘crisis', ‘emergen-

cies’.
