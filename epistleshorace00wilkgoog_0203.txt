1³. meus nollem. ‘has got thoroughly chilled': cp. Verg.
Georg. 111. 327 ubi sitim collegerit hora: so in Ov. Met. v. 446
the inferior MSS. have sitim collegerat, though there the better
have conceperat. Itis more common to findfrcgns contrahere.

furnos, used in Sat. 1. 4, 37 as a place of public resort,
though not, as the dictionaries based on F reund have it, as ‘a
warmingplace'3 apparently the furni were public beke-houses
(Juv. vn. 4), and Horace means to say that when a man has got
verny cotld‚ he ο6111ῑ gotanyyhere where he can be well warmed‚
wr ou meaning osayt ere.

1⁵1. Incolumi tacit [id] qnod, ‘is to a healthy man what.'
Editors generally quote as parallel the use offecere with the
dative for ‘to suit’‚ as in Prop.1v. (111) 1, 20 nen saciet capiti
dura corona meo, or more commonly with ad, as in Ov. Am. 1.
α, 16 frena minus sentit quisquis ad arntofaeit, Her. vl. 128
Medeae sacrent ad scelus onzne nranus. But in this construction
an object is never expressed or (as here) implied.

iifltempt at assimilation from the better-established φελόνης :ycp
Tisch. and W. H. on a Tim. iv. 13. Nothing is known of the
derivation of the word in either language.

campestre, i. q. subligaculum, a light apron‚ originally worn
under the toga in the place of the tunic, a custom retained by
candidates for office, and by some old-fashioned people (cp. on
A. P. 59), but more commonly retained only as the sole garment
⁴worn in the exercises of the Campus. Lewis and Short are mis-
leading in supposing it to have been generally worn in hot
weather in place of the tunic. Cp. Marquardt Rom. Privatalt.

19. liberte. in summer it was customary to bathe in the
Tiberr Carm. 111. 12, 6, Sat. 11. ι, 8.

caminus [whence our chimney, Fr. nemine, through comi-
natu] a fixed ‘stove'‚ as compared with the moveable foculus or
brazier. Chimneys do not appear to have been common in
South Italy, and few have been found at Pompeii except in baths
and bate-house, but in Rome and in Northem Italy they were
doubtless frequently in use. Cp. Overbeck Pompeii, p. 340, and
hence correct Becker Gallus, 11. 269.
