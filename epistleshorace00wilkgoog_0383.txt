tnnutnra cannot refer, as some have supposed, either to com-
position, or to metaphor.

4⁹. tndlotts=anuelora ‘Indicia verba appellavit: philo·-
sopbi enim dicunt indicandamm rerum causa inventas esse voces!
fazrpllpmgptr'hraps this use of indictuni is intended as a case oi

abdito rerum ‘new conceptions’, not previously brought to
view. The great majority oi MSS. read renem et, which was
· omitted (silently) by Bentley, and which almost all editors recog·
{ize as indefensible. There is a similar erroneous addition in
p. 11. 1, 73.

bu. mnotutis=qui cinctu induebantur. The drutus was a
broad waistband, or lom-eloth, worn by the old Romans instead
of the tunica under the tago, and by the ounger men in their

exercises in the Campus, whence it was aibo called campestre.
The younger Cato wore it in accordance with the ancient practice
(Ascon. p. 30, 9 Or. Catopraetariadicium‚ quia aestate agebatur, χ

sine tunica exercuit, campestri sub toga cinctus), and Porph. here
says: omnes enim Cethegi unum morem servaverunt Romae...
nunquam enim tunica usi sunt: ideo cinctutos eos deit qnoniam
cinctus est genus tunicae infra pectus aptatae. As the arms and
breast were lest bare Lucan 11. 543 speaks of exsertique manus
cresana cetegi ; and Sil. Itul.vl11. 587 has ipse umero exsertus
gentili moresparentum difficili gaudebat equo. This must be dis·
tinguished rom the cinctus Gabinus, which was the old way of
wearing the toga iu time os war. Cp. Marquardt, Rb'm. Privatalt.
11. 159, 167. Several figures wearing the cinctus are represented
in Daremberg and Saglio's Dicttbnnaire des Antiquitbs‚ p. 1173.

⁶1. conducet ‘you will be allowed’: not very commonly
used so without the dative expressed, as in Ep. 1. 17, 36,
11. r. 41.

pudentor=cum pudore, i. e· ‘with moderation'.

52. timue: Bentley wished to change this into fiactaque,
because offingere in v. 50, but the repetition is pleasing rather
than otherwise. The phrase sacere navum verbum is good
enough in itsell: cp. cte. Orat. 62, arr with Sandys’ note.

nabebunt fldem ‘will find acceptance’ or ‘credit’. The
limitationis at first sight by no means clear. Why should
newly·coined words find favour only is they ‚0⁰¹¹Je. falling like¹
