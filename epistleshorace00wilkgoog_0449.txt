Greek poetry which has moved the hearts of rnen, the last
Greek hexameters which retain the ancient cadence, the ma·
jestic melancholy flow’. Hellenica p. 489.

404. vitae monstrata vta est, by the gnomlc poeta,
Solon, Theognis. Phoeylides: Mahaffy Gr. Lit. 1. 175, 187 ff.

mua rasum Pindar, Simonides and Bacchylides were
patronised by Hiero and Thero, Anacreon by Polycrates of
Sarnos. ‘The rise and prevalence of tyrants in Greece‚ and
their desire of spreading culture about them, created a demand,
and α comiortable prospect sor professional court poets’. Ma·

405. Hortis: hythe time of Horace this had become a
merely conventional literary epithet of the Muses: but its earlier
usage (Hesiod Op· 1 Μοῦσαι Πιερίηθεν, ἀοιδῇσι κλείουσαι, Sappho ·
frag. 4βρόδινν των ἐκ Πιερίας) is of much importante as pointing
toan early school oi Greek poetry in that partos hessaly
about Mt. Olympus. Cp. Geddes Homero Question pp. 25, αις.

ludus ‘festivals'r cp. Ep. 11. ι, '140 ff. Acron refers this
to the lym, Orelli to the dramatic representations at the Dio·
nysia τὰ κατ’ ἀγρούς in December, which marked the close of
the year’s' toil: both unduly limit the meaning. But Acron
is right in taking σακίων as a quasi-adjectival addition, ‘to
finish their long toils’.

406. na...stt‚ not imperative, but final: ‘lthis 1 say) lest·
etc. So take Carm. 11. 4, r nc sit ancillae tibi amor pudori...

nowhere admissible.

408. natura...au arte: a theme often discussed. Pindar
was perhaps the first to lay stress on the great im rtance of
φοὴ, as compared with μελέτης cp. Olymp. 11. 86 155) σοφὸς
ὁ πολλὰ εἰδὼς φυᾷ· μαθόντες δὲ λάβροι παγγλωσσίᾳ, κόρακες
ὥς, ἄκραντα γαρύετον Διὸς πρὸς ιίρνιχα θεῖον, where Dr Fennell
finds a reference to Simonides and Bacch lides: Prof. Jebb
doubts whether Simonides can he included &arnnal os Hellenic

Studies, 111. p. τόν). So Olymp. tx. roo (152) τὸ δὲ φυᾷ ’

Naturally Horace's solution ol the question-that both natural
gilts and training are needed-is the one generally accepted:
