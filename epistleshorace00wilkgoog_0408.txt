ἡμέρᾳ, διὰ τὸ τοῦ ἀπόντος εἶναι τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν· καὶ οὗ δὲ ἐνδεεῖς,
τούτου μάλιστα ἐπιθυμοῦσι. Hence the meaningis ‘eager for
longer lile'. Cp. Soph.Frag.Acris.641› τοῦ ζῆν peip οὐδεὶς
ὡς ὁ γηράσκων ἐρᾷ. So Acron rightly explains it. But again we
must confess that the expression is unparalleled‚ and hardly in
keeping with Horace’s frequent use offuturum elsewhere.

querulus: Ar. Rhet. Η. 13, 15 ὅθεν dorpanei εἰσιν καὶ οὐκ
εὐτράπελοι οὐδὲ φιλογέλοιοι.

laudator emporis acti: ib. §12 διατελοῦσι γάρ τὰ γενόμενα
λέγοντες· ἀναμιμνησκόμενοι γὰρ ἥδονται. Like Nestor in Homer.

llll. multa...ad1munt: ‘'anni venire dicuntur ad quadra·
gesimum sextum usque annum, inde abireiam accedente senecta’.
Comm. Cruq. This phrase, like that in Sophocles, from which
it was possibly borrowed (Trach. 547 ὀρω γὰρ ἥβην τὴν μὲν
ἔρτοοσον πρόσω, τὴν δὲ φθίνουσιν), ‘supposes an ἀκμή, a definite
ppint to which lise ascends and t'rorn which it descends'c cp.

ickham’s note on Carm. 11. 5, 14, a passage which, ns he
jnstly points¹ out, is not really parallel. The F rench say Ue
homme sur son retour. Cp. Tennyson’s Miller's Daugtur:

There’s somewhat flows to us in life,
But more is taken quite away. ι

Schiitz prefersa second explanation given by Acron, according
to which all years that lie besore usare called venientes, and
those which are past are recedentes. The old man has few years
before him, and therefore cannot expect so many commoda as the
young man. Conington renders

Years as they come, bring blessings in their traina
, Years as they go, take blessings back again.

· This is ambiguous, but points in the direction of Sebiitz’s
view.

176. ne torte, etc. You must rememberthis, lest you should '

assign the characters wrongly. Schiitz connects this with mora·
bimur, not with adimunt: and certainly the connexion of thought
yffi v. 178 is closer than with v. 175. For the rhyme cp. v. 99

ΠΒ. aevo goes with minuens as well aswith apnr. The
adiuncta ere according to Acron quac bene meant et congruant
· aetati:=attributes, τὰ καθ’ αὐτὰ συμβεβηκότα, or ‘necessary
accidents‘. Cp. Mill’s Logic 1. 7, ἓ 8, eud Cic. Acad. 1. 5, ar
quae beatae οἰιοι adiuncta sunt, ‘things inseparable frome
