276 HORAZ'I EPISTULAE.

ephebus. The word is used by Cicero 'm its strict sense, de Nat.

D. 1. 28, 79 Athenis cum essem, egregitur epulorum etc, but

not apparentlyby Plautus. There is an interesting account of

tclpe Ephebi in (362pes’ University Life at Athens: cp. Hermann,
nAtugm.

1¹12. ntuutt: Ep. 1. 7, 91.

173. munus: Atellanarum sempter, Comm. Cruq.
This is probably onlya guess, and an unlucky one, which has
misled many editors. The evidence for the existence of such
a writer is veryslight and untmstworthy‚ audit seems quite
clear that Horace is speaking throughout of Plautus. Dossennus
was a standing character in⁴ the Atellan plays. Varro de Ling.
Lat. v11.95 says: dictum mundior a ntandendo, unde manducari,
a quo in Atellanis ad obsenum vocant Manducnm, where Miiller
corrects (Addend. p. 303) the corrupt words to Dossenune.
Ritschl(Parerg.Praef. p. xt11.)at the suggestion of Bergk, on
the strength of this, interprets the present passage ‘quantus ipse
scurra sit in scurris parasitis describendis'‚ pointing out that
Horace here touches upon the four leading characters of the
fabrslo pallanta, but censures Plautus especially for his treatment
of the fourth. Suetonius Galb. 13, after describing the niggardli·
ness of Galba, adds queen aduentus eius nou perinde gratus
fuit: sitque proximo spectaculo apparuit: siquidem Atellanis
notissimum cauticum exorsis Venit ione simus a vilia, cunuti
sinrul spectatores consentisnte voce reliquom partem retulerunt
oc saepius versu repetito ogerum. Here the corrupt words have

been corrected by Lachmann to Venit Dorsennus, though Roth l

prefers to read with Casaubon‚ Onesimus, which is certainly much
nearer to the MSS. The point evidently lies in the avaricions
character of the man named, whoever he may havebeen. Teuffel,
Rom. Ls't. ξ 9, 3 says ‘Dossennus (dorsumlis a cunning sharper,
the dottore ἰ Ι do not know that there is any other basis for

this view than the conjecture asto the derivation of his name
t‘haud dubie a dorsi gibbere dicta’ Ritschl), the humo-backed

man being regarded as wisc, as we see from Aesop. From the .

name Mundusus it seems more probable that Dossennus was
a glutton, ‘quae persona magnis malis et crepitantibus dentibus
insignis in pompa Circensium ludorum duci solebat’ (Miiller on
Varro, l. c.): and this is the view taken by Prof. Nettleship ine
paper read before the Oxford Philological Society. Ritschl
however prefers to regard the name as used here quite generally
for a buffoon, without reference to the special features of the part.
Festus, p. 3⁶4 M. quotes from au Atellan play by Novius called
Duo Dosseni. Cp. Ribbeck, Fragm. Com. p. 257 and 274.
Plin. N. H. xlv. 13· 9a says sed Fabius Dossennus nis verse'bus
deuenit, etc. 1t is possible that this writer got his name from
the character, which he may have resembled, or played well (so
