Horace, p. rar, Preller Gr. Myth. r. 484. The name is doubt·
less derived from hduos ‘maw’, with which is connected
himo: χάσματα. In Apul. Men 1. 17, ν. 11 the word issimply
one ol abuse =‘old witches’. The vampire Lamia, who appears
in Keats's poem, is os later origin. mahat, ie describe how

842. Ramnes, the first ol' the three original centuries of
knights, the other two being Tities and Luceres (Liv. 1. 13).
Much difficulty has been found in understanding why Ramnes
should be used here to denote the younger part of the audience.
But the term seems only to have been used oi the knights equo
publio, who sersed as cavalry, not of those who belonged to the
ordo equester by virtue of their census; and the period of service
for cavalry was limited to ten cam aigns, so that all these equites
would be under 3ο. Hence Q. dicero de pet. cons. 8, 33 de·
scribes them as illa adulescentulorum oetas, Liv. 11. ι 3 as proceres
iuventutis, while he makes Perseus speak of them as equites
seminarium senatus (xm. 61). There is no special reason why
Ramnes should have been chosen‚ rather than one of the other
centuries Cp. Madvig Verf. u. Vens. 1. 161-2. celat:
‘haughty’‚ whether we take it as an epithet, or as an adverbial
predicate with praetereunt, cp. Liv. vrr. 16 celsi et feroces in

θῶ. mnu: Ep. 1. ao, a. The question has been raised
whether an author received anything directly stom his publisher;
it seems clear that he did, at least in the time of Seneca (de
Benev. vl1.6)and Martial (Χῖ. soille cp. Becker Gallus⁸ 11.

make a good profit: Mart. xlv. 194ion Lucan) ssent quidam qui

mare mandi: here just in the opposite sense to Ep.1. ao,
13 (cp. note). Martial was read in Gaul, Spain and Britain, and
complains that he gets no profit from his British readers (xl. 3,
6). Pliny Ep. 1x. 11 isdelighted to find that his works have a
good sale at Lugdunum.

84⁶. lencm moroges ‘extends to a distant day ', proleptic:

longum noto ‘known to distant parts ’, not so well.
