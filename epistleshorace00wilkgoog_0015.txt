Pleu-FACE: ’ .·

THE need os a¹ new edition os Horace's
Epistles with English notes wiil not be denied
-by any one, who knows what important contri-
butions to the criticism os this work are stili
inaccessible to English readers, The difficulty
of the t'ask has 'made itseli more and more felt
during every year which has been spent upon
the preparation ‘of the present edition. I will
‘only say that, had not the excellent notes os
ΜΓ Yonge been constructed on a different scale
'from those here offered, or had there been any
hope of' the early appearance of Mr-Wickham’s
long-promised second volume, the present work
would not have been undertaken.

The notes ‘to the present edition may seem
to some too ‘full and len'gthy. For this sulness
there are three insin reasons ’(1) There are Latin
and Greek authors, whose works may properly

-be provided with bries dogmatie notes, suited to
students who are not ripe so'r critical discussions.
