any explanation such as Orelli's ‘non vocantis, sed declarantis
osse videtur'. Cases like v. 301 o ego laevus, 80111. a, 1070
magnus posthac inimicis risus, 11. 7, 69 o toan servus and the like
are entirely different. Persius simply copies Horace in 1. 61
vos o patricius sangnis. Cp. Kiihner Ansf Cromna. 1. p. 080.
According to Plutarch Num. xxr. Numa Pompilius had four
sons, Pompus, Pinus, Calpus, and Mamercus, from whom the
Pomponii, Pinarii, Calpurnii, and Mamercii were respectively
descended. The real origin of the name Calpurnius is quite
unknown: Pompilius is formed from 0 Sabellian pompe corre·
sponding to the Latin quinque: cp. Corssen1.² 116.

dence 01 the Bland. oct. and the oldest Berne MS. force us 10
adopt a reading which 01 first sight is less attractive than the

reading is genuine it is hard to see how the much 10101 word
praesectum should have got into our oldest authorities. Besides
it is somewhat tautologous with od unguem. Workers in wood
or stone were accustomed to test the finish of their work by
passing the nail over it: cp. Columell. xl. 2, 13 nurteries si
roboreo est, ab uno fabro dolari od unguem debet: Apul. dc Deo
Socr¹ Prol. p. 106 Hild. non lapidem offeram—leviter cx omnibus
oris od unguem coaequatum. [Similarly Verg. Georg. 11. 277
uses in unguem quadret for ‘exactly tally'.] Persius 01 once
imitates and explains in 1. 64 ut per leve severos effundat iunctura
ungui& and Horace has Sat. 1. 5, 3² od unguem factus ltomo.
Now 11 is 0 common experience that the nail is more sensitive to
irregularities, when it has just been pared; and this is the mean·

the use of the idiom, but it is not required by the participle.
Hence praesectum is really better in itself, as well as better sup-
ported thau perfectum. It is commonly said that this Latin
idiom is imitated from the Greek εἰς ὄνυχα, but it is doubtful
whether the Greek phrase has always reference 10 the same
usage: in the saying ascribed to Polycletus χαλεπώτατον εἶναι
rd ἔργον, ὅταν ἐν ὄνυχι ὁ πηλὸς γίγνηται the meaning seems 10 be
rather that the rask is most difficolt when the minutest details
