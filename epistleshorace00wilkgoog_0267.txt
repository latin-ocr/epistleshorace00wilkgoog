1-ao. Cratinus eff alb, Maecenas, beld tbat peetus destined
ta immortality were always inspired by wine; and from tbe
earliest days poets bave been trpers. I sarii tbat tbe saber were
better fitted scr business tbau paetry: and since tben my imitators
bave been always drinking. But mare is needed sar successful
rivalry, than an aping as dress and looks.

1. doute ο cp. Carm. 111. 8, 3 docte sermones utriusque linguae.

Cratino: the fondness oi Cratinus ior wine was made the
subject oi many jests among his contemporaries. Aristophanes
in the Peace (roo—703) says that he died oi grief at seeing a
jar iull oi wine smashed in an invasion of the Lacedaemoniuns,
a joke which gains instead oi losing point, ii we accept the
statement oi the Senot, on Ar. Av. 521 that he was living at
the time. Cp. also Schol. on Eq. 400 ris...rdbvaor διαβάλλει
τὸν Κρατῖνον. He adds thatin his play of the Πυτίνῃ Cratinus
tpntss‘ttd‘tttstissltlttttltdtgitttlt ttulit?
because he had deserted her ior Μέθη. ‘ Athenaeus (11. 9 p. 143
Schweigh.) has preserved an epigram on him by Nicaenetus‚
οἶνός τοι χαρίεντι τέλει ταχὺς ἵππος dorici· ὕδωρ δὲ πίνων οὐδὲν

dr τέκοι σοφόν. τοῦτ’ ἔλεγεν, Διόνυσε, καὶ ἔπνεεν οὐχ ἐνὸς ἀσκοῦ
Κρατῖνος, ἀλλὰ παντὸς ὠδώδει τίθου.

2. plnum diu go together, tor'vivere needs no adverb:
Carm. lv. 9, 11 mvuntque commissi calores Aeoliae fidibus

puellae.

3. nonanus: Schiitz takes this as an ablative, like tentore
in'v. 13. I think ir is unquestionably a dative (Roby ἓ 1146,
S· G. § 476); and mnnot, see whya construction found twice
at least in Vergil (Aen.1.44o neque cernitur ulli, 111. 398 male‘s
habitantur moenia Graiis), and several times· in Ovid (Her.
rx. 46; Fast. 11. 61, 111.108‚ 325, v. rso, 3033 Trist. v. ro. 37
etc.) should be pronounced by Mr Page on Canu. 1. 6, r ‘quite
inadmissible' in Horace: Madvig allows eran uni aret alteri
militi...audiuntur in Liv. v. 6, 14, and quaerentibus utrinque
ratio initur in Liv. 1. 23, ro, though in xxll· 34, 8 he cor-
rects to contemni a patribus desierint. For apparent instances in
Cicero (eg. De Am. 11, 38) cp. Madvig on de Fin. 1. 4, 11.
Here direct agency is denoted: in v. 13 textore indicates rather
the instrumentum, ‘by the help oi‘ or ‘thanlrs to ’. Both these
enses differ materially from those in which the ablative oi the
substantive is accompanied by an adjective, sor which cp. note
on Ep. 1. r, 94.

ut ‘ever since’‚ Roby§ 1719, S. G. ἕ 723. The Muses
drank at first only from springs like Castalia and Hippocrene:
but since the days when Bacchus enrolled t‘tanquam in legionem
