EPISTLE XIII.

This letter is uominally addressed to a certain Vinius, who ’
has been charged with the delivery of some ol Horace's poems
to Augustus. From the jest in v. 8 it is clear that his cognomen
was Asina, or perhaps (as Porphyrion calls him) Asella; the
more usual form ol the name being however Asellus (eg.
claudius Asellus in Cic. de Orat. 11. 64, 258, Annius Asellus
in Cic. in Verr. Act. 11. 1, 41, 104). Acron calls him C. Vinius
Fronto, givin Asello as his father’s cognomen. From his
possession of t ree names it is clear that he was not a slave: on
the other hand the tone, which Horace adopts in addressing
him, shows that he was not, as some have supposed, a friend ol
the Emperor. It is a plausible conjecture, although nothing
more than a conjecture, which finds in him one of the five y
yeomen sarmers ou Horace’s Sabine estate (Ep. 1. 14, 3). Th

&real purpose of the letter was doubtless to indicate to Augus

that Horace had no intention to thmst lris trifles upon him,
when not in the humour sor them. It has been generally
assumed that the volumina contained the first three books ol the
Odes. If this was the case, we must assume that this Epistle
was considerably earlier than Epist. r, the first tides ol which
cannot have been written immediately after the publication os
the first important collection ol Horace’s lyrics. There is
nothing in thrs letter which tells against Frankes (very generally
accepted) view, that the first three books ol the Odes were
published together in Μ. ²3· Nor on the other hand is there
anything init inconsistent with Christ's belief that they were ’
not published besore Μ. ao. This question must be decided ,
by other considerations, mainlyby the interpretation ol Carm. 1. 3, ’
and 11. 9. Cp. Wickham’s Introduction-Augustus was absent
from Italy from the latter part of Μ. aa until October Β. c. ¹9·
It has been generally assumed that Horace sent Vinius stom his ζ
Sabine villa to Augustus at Rome. II so, the date assigned by ’
Christ becomes untenable. But he argues with somelorcethat ¹
as Horace's publishers‚ the Sosii, were at Rome, it is much ,
more probable that a copy ol his poems was sent srom the ¹
capital to Augustus when he was still abroad. Certainly the
language ol v. ro is almost too exaggerated to be humorous. is
applied to the five and twenty miles or so ol excellent road (the
via Valeria and via Tiburtina) which lay between Varia and
Rome. ⁴Ritter supposes the date to have been the early part ol
Μ. 18, thch is probably too late. Cp. Introduction-There
is little to be said in favour of the view, which some bave
adopted, that the Satires were the volumina sent at this time to
Augustus. The Satires were probably completed by Μ. 303
