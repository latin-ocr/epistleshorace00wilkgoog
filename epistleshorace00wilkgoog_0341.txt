and no fatal objection lies against this soree 01 the word. liu-
manus like ἀνθρώπινος (cp. Dem. in Mid. 527 ἀνθρωπίνη καὶ

have hesitated to accept it. Ribbeck conjectures (very badly)

rection to HVMANE must have followed as a matter of course.
There is also strong confirmation from Terence, whom Horace
seems to have known by beart, in Adelph. 783 edepol cam-

not gain much by assuming with Schiitz that hamane points to
a man as the measure 01 the convenience, ‘convenient for one
