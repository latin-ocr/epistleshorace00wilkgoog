nuos: Porph. says ‘ad ravim'‚ i.e. ‘till they are hoarse’,
which has found much support. But itis not easy to see why
the neighbours should bawl so long at the impostor, as to ruin
their voices over him. The word more probably denotes only
the harsh dissonant eries of the mocking crowd.

EPISTLE xvln.

This epistle is in some MSS. and by the scholiasts taken as a
continuation of the precedingone, and the latter even spealr of
‘Lollius Scaeva ’. The only justification for this is that at fust
sight the main theme, the manner in which an inferior should
associate with a superior in rank and wealth, appears to be the
same¹ in both. But a little consideration shows that the position
of Lollius is very different from that of Scaeva. The latter is
evidently of narrow means, and probably of humble origin: his
object in courting a patron is to obtain a decent livelihood t the
former is in possession of an ancestral estate (v. 60) with alake

The date isixed by vv. 55—57 to tac, ao: it is therefore ex-
ceediugly improbable that the epistle was addressed‚ as the
scholiasts say and as Ritter believes, to the Lollius who was
consul in tac. ar (Ep. 1. ao, 18)) but it may probably have been
addressed tu his son. Lollia Paulina the wife of Caligula, was
the daughter os M. Lollius consularis according to Tac. Anu.
xn. r. Pliny N. H. lx. 35, 118 slpealrs of her as the grand-
daughter of the consul of 1). e. 21. his latter statement is quite
in harmony with chronology, for she was married to Caligula,
her second husband in n. 1). 38, and in Ἀ. 1). 49 was put forward
as a candidate for the hand of Claudius: hence she can hardly
have been born before Α. 1). 10. The account given by Tacitus
is'reconcileable with that of Pliny only ou the assumption that
the son of M. Lollius the consul of uc. 21 was himself comat
affictus, though his name does not ap ear in the Fasti, and·
hence we cannot determine the date. the reading maxime is
right in Ep. 11. 1, the father of Lollius must have been the man
to whom the two epistles were addressed3 for it was the custom
of the eldest son to bear his father's praenomen. If we read there.
Maxime, the identificatiou remains probable, although there is
not the same evidence for it.
