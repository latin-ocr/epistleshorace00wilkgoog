21. asoti mutus: cp.Ep.11.1‚ 149 (itote). ΤΙτε urreisi
or ‘pitcher ', though uot necessarily smaller thau the amphora,
was so as a sule: and the sentence gains iu point il we suppose
that to a vessel of the size olan ampliora, the shape os au arcein

non ego, eum senio, si fhrte qaid optiliu exit, quando haec rarahriih
est, si quid tamen optimati, laudari notuam.

28. quidvis, a reading restored by Bentley ior the vulgate
quodvis: the latter has the support oi almost all MSS„ aud
would mean quod instituis: but this is very frigid, and Ritteris
the only recent editor who defends it.

dumtaxat ‘provided only it be'. Cp. Reid on Cic. Lael.
553. simplex, ie. constituting a single and unilorm whole.

24—31. Prof. Nettleshiptalres these lines to be again apara·
phrase os the Greek original, with ⁴Horace's comment iuvv.
32—37. The desire to avoid a fault nouit be directed by knoio·
ledge, or the oppositefizultis incurret.

25. suade recti ‘byour idea of what is right': speciosis not
here iu a bad sense, a mere phantom: cp. Quint. vm. 3, 56
κακόζηλον vocatur quicquid est ultra virtutem, quoties ingenium
indisso caret et pecie boni fallitur: omnium in eloquentiis odiorum

manium. The word is ofteuusediu Cicero with the meaning ³

oi *general notiuu ’= ἰδέα.

28. 'levia ‘smoothness ⁹, τήν λειότητα of the rhetoricians‚ tc
which vigour aud energy (δεινότης) was in danger oi being sacri·
freed. Bentley preferred lenio, which has very slight authority:

the passage from Cic. Brut. 48, 177 sunt eius aliquot mationa ex Ῐ

quibus...lenitas eius sine nervis conspici potest, adduced in support
of this reading, tells really rather against it. We do not want
quite a repetition of the same idea, but a slight variatiou, as in
brevis, l( obscurior. A man who airus at an excellence is in
danger of falling into a fault, closely connected with it: but
lenr'ei would denote not an excellence, but a fault. Keller points
out that as the archetype was undoubtedly written in capitals‚

the difference between the two words is uot so slight as it is in ¹

MSS. written iu small letters.

Quint. vm. proem. 18 resistam iis, qui omisso rerum, qui nervi

In good Latin nervus, like νεῦρον, always denotes sium or
