Suetonius (Aug. 81) says that Augustus quiz calida fhrnenta nou
proderant, frigidis curari coatus auctoreA nimia Musa. The same
cold·water bandages which would reduce inflammatIon might
naturally be regarded as chilling a healthy glow. If curarum
is the objective genitive, we must give to fomenta the meaning
of ‘remedies’, (as in Cic. Tusc. 11. 24, 59 irasc sunt solacia,
laec fhrnenta nummorum dolorum: cp. Epod. xt. 17 ingrata fo·
nanta vulnus nil malum levantia), and translate frigida ‘seeble'‚
‘powerless', as in Ov. Pont. tv. a, 4 5 quid nisi Pierides, solacia
smgida, restat? But this leaves it too obscure what is meant
by ‘the unavailing remedies against cares’ which Florus is to
abendon. Orelli's way os taking curarum as a genitive of origin,
sanicula arising from cares, leaves the origin and application ot
the term fomenta quite unexplained. The dictionaties based on
Freund translate ‘nourishment', ie. all that feeds your cares,

³⁰. sit has much more authority than si: Bentley has shewn
that either would stand by itself (c . Ep. 1. 7, 39; Roby§ 1755,

note of interrogation at the end of the sentence beginning an
male, so that this may be a direct question. With Bentley’s
cst, which has no authority, I do not see how to account for
conveniat. Macleane’s full-stop at rescinditur is positively bad
