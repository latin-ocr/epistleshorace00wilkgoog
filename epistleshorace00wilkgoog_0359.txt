, (cp. Ep. 11. 1, 105 note), as the dictionaries based on Freund

say, for then theconstruction becomes inexplicabie, but ‘by what
you have paid down'. Yon must pay in any case, says Horace;
the only question is whether you have just paid, or paid long
ago. Here oum=uuonoam of the next line. Cp. viuere rapto
in Verg. Aen. v11. 749, and often in Livy, eg. vn. 15, 13.
Mr Yonge rightly says that the stress lies on the participle, not,
as would be required in our idiom‚ on the finite verb: hence
viras numerato=numeraveris. Cp. A. P. 104 (note), Sat. 11.

Ter. And. 175: nequeenim rgnari sumus ante malorum (τῶν πρὶν
κακῶν) in Verg. Aen. 1. 198. But the great preponderance of
MS. authority is in favour not of quondam, but of quoniam and
Keller warmly defends this reading, placing a comma at olim,
and the note of interrogation at mum. His arguments are
(r) that the position of quondam makes its grammatical connexion
somewhat obscure; and (a) that quondam is not found with a
substantive until later Latin. The objections to quomam are
(1) that it is rather a prosaic word, found only in the Satires
(1. 6, 11; 11.3,201; 4, 253 6, 51) though used by Vergil and
other poets: (1) that it is much more in the style of Horace
to have a short rhetorical question, followed by an example,
than a long argumentative question, such as the retention of
quoniam would involve. A rhetorical question does not well
admit of the addition of the reasons which determine the
answer. Besides, with a question ending at unum, red fol·
lows very awkwardly. The place which quoniam would talre in
the line might be defended on the plea of metrical convenience.

But as quendam and quoniam would be represented in the MSS.
' by almost indistinguishable abbreviations‚ their evidence need
not go for much: and the former clearly makes the better con·
struction.

Cp. Tac. Ann. xlv. 53 per haec suburbana incedit. Veii had

been lying in ruins since its capture by Camillus (11.0. 396), and .

its land had been divided among the soldiers of Julius Caesar in
uc. 45. These formed a small colony, which was dispersed
during the wars of the triumvirs, and Propertius 1v. (v.) ro, 29
