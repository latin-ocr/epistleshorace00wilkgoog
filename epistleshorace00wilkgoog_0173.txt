or sevum for laevum, whence Ritter repeats saurim, aconjecture
which has deservedly found but little support: savum though
admitted by some editors is not defensible.

uocat, ‘press’, with energy. traua pondera, a very difficolt

neth: Lueret. 11. 218, VI. 574, Lucan Ι. 57, a view which,
though ignored by Macleane, has received the weighty support
of Lachmann (on Lucret. p. 381), Haupt (on Ov. Met. 1. 13)
and Ritter. as well as Conington: ‘at risk of tumbling down'.
Orelli takes it of the weights on the counter ofa shop, support·
ing his interpretation by the picture of a shop at Pompe1i‚ and
Keller warmly approves: but is it possible to understand so im·
portant a limiti notion as ‘of the shop'? Others interpret
pondera of obstac es generall . The old view has recently been
advocated by T. Mommsen (Fleckeisen’s Jahrb. 1874, p. 466 ft),
Nissen (Pompeiam Stud. p. 566), and Kriiger. Overbeck Pom·
ριίὶ3 p. 56 describes the broader streets as having three such
stepping stones (Fig. 19), the narrower‚ one. It is admitted
that there is no evidence, except in the scholiasts, that these were
called pondua: but in face of the difficulties still attaching to
Gesners interpretation (and especially to the force which it
requires us to give to tram), it is perhaps best to follow the
earlier view, which must have been based upon some traditional
authority, seeing how little there is in the words themselves to
suggest it. The picture thus suggested is that of a candidate
in the cumbrous whitened toga, pressed by his attendant to
hurry across the street in order to shake hands with an in·
’ fluential elector on the path opposite. Τὴε street was usually
narrow‚ in Pompeii never more than about ²4 feet broad, and
often only niue or teu, inclusive of, the paths (margines), but the
latter were as a mle much raised.
