390 Ars POETJCA.

282. excidit, not as Schiitz ex laude, but rather as Orelli
puts it, ’παρρησία impetu quodam suo delapsa est in petulantiam’.
ex· denotes the change from a previous state, but it is not neces·
sary that what this state was should be indicated in the context.

288. lege: Suidas sv. ’Δντίμᾳχος says ἐδόκει οὗτος ψήφισμα
πεποιηκέναι μὴ δεῖν κωμῳδεῖν ἐξ imperor: this was ih B.c. 4403
but the law was repealed three years afterwards, The law
passed by Syracosius (uc. 415) seems to have been solely to
restrict comic writers from taking as their subject theproianation
oi the mysteries. Cp. Meineke Com. Gr. Fr. 11. 949. The '
oligarchs of rae. 4¹¹ seem to haye silenced political comedy by
terror not by law,

m turpiter must go with obticuit3 the disgrace lay in
the fact that the outrageous violence oi the chorus had brought
upon it the restraint oi the law.

mitt. Versatility ond talent are by no means wanting to

the Roman ports: they leave cvera slzown originalr'ty in tlte dromas
taken from their notional history ; they might riool tlte Greeks rs

this word, which is derived from the tego praetexta wom by
magistrates at Rome, ought to be praetextam and this form is
that usual in the grammarians. Brit Asinius Pollio in writing to
Cicero (Ep. x. 32, 3 and 5) twice uses praetexto: so does the
writer oi the ancient lite of Persius, ascribed to Suetonius,

scriptas, where Mulier calls tqhis form the more correct. The
sabulopraetextata was first written by Naevius who composed
two on the early history of Rome, Lupus and Romulus-the
latter possibly the earliest source of the familiar legend-and one
Clastidium, on contemporary history, all three of great merit,
according to Ribbeck: cp. Rern. T rag. pp. 63-75. Τ wo pras·
textae are ascribed to Ennius, one to Pacuvius, and two to
Accius. (For tpe comoedia togata of Afranius and others, cp. Ep.
11.1, 57 note.

290. unum quemque: cp. Ep. 11, a, 188 (note). Orelli
thinks that by ‘a malicious irony’ Horace is here illustrating the
carelessness which he censuros: but no such explanation suits
the parallel instances.

292. Pompilius amnis, the nominative sor the vocative in
solemn address as in Carm. 1. a, 43 almas filius Mariae: Livy
