Campania seems to lend some support to this local origm of the ’
- term. But-on the whole the second explanation is to be pre·
secred, though not quite in the form given (from Festus) by
Paulus: fascinum denotas prirnarily the evil eye, but as this
was supposed to be averted by the use of an obscene symbol,
fascinum carne to be a synonym for the symbol itself. As the
effects of the evil eye were especially to he dreaded in marriage
the chanting of obscene verses was considered anessential part of
the nuptial ceremony, and it was almost solely in this connexion
that the Fescennine verses survived in the later days of the
Republic. Cp. Catull. Lxr. rao ne diu taceatprocax Ir'esceunina
iocata'o (so Munro: Fascenm'na locutio Ellis): Sen. Med. 113fcsta
dr'cux fundat cenur‘cia Fescenninus: and see Munro’s Cn'ticisms
and Elucr'dutious of Catullus, pp. 76-78. The abusive songs,
however, by which soldiers tried to avert the frowns of F ortune
from a general during his triumph, were of the same nature, and
. the term was occasionally used of scurrilous verses of any kind:
cp. Macrob. 11. 4, ar tuuporibus triumviralibus Pollio curu Fes-
cenninos in eum Augustus scripsisset, ait at ego taceo, non est
enim facile ineam scribere qui potest praescribere. ib. 111. 14, 9
Cato suasorem unu ignobilem spatzhtorem et Fescenninum uocat.
Cp. Nettleship in Journ. Phil. xr. 190.

lavata. Bentley, on the ground of the assumed Etruscan ]
origin of these verses, read invecta, objecting at the same time ³
to the phrase inuenire licmtiam. But the foreign origin is l
exceedingly doubtful: it is impossible (with Terrenum. Lr‘t. r
Μ) to combine the two derivations of the term Fescenm'nus,
and the form which the word takes is due probably only toa
popular etymology, like that which has given us Jerusalem
artichoke for girasele (Max Miiller Lecturus 11. 368), while, as
Schiitz justly says, it is difficult to see what other word Horace
could have used for iuvenire. Besides, the custom of rustic merry·
making, such as is described by Verg. Georg. 11. 385—391,
would more naturally give rise at horne tothish'nterchange of
s rtive and licentioris abuse, than lead to its importation from
a rond. We have specimens of thisrustic abuse in Theocrit.
