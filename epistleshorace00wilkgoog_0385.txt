extant treatise De Re Rustica has come down to us precludes us
from ascertaining in what way he enriched the Latin language.
Ennius did very much to fix the literary pronunciation of Latin,
and to determine its vocabulary.

the abl. is strictly one of respect, but the notion of severance comes
in. J. S. RJ. The silua corresponds to the aetas, the solea to the
individual verba. Bentley printed silvis folia, supposing that folii

Horace. The quotation iu the grammarian Diomedes p. 394 P. nt
