28³. 'moenium 'lhere were three well-knownpoets oi this
name. (r) Choerilus of Athens, one os the earliest tragic poets,
who produced many plays between B.c. 523 and rac. 483: (a) C.
of Samos, the composer oi an epic poem on the Persian wars, a

Alexanderp to lidia, This last isrythe one here meant: in A. Ρ.
357 he is taken as the type of apoet who sometimes ‘deviares
into’ excellence. Acron here says that he had only seven good
’ lines in his poem on the exploits of Alexander, ior each oi
which he received a gold piece. On A. Ρ. 357 he adds that
Alexander had bargained to give him this reward, on condition
that the bard should receive a blow for every bad verse, and
that he died os the blows. The lingis reported to have said
malle se Thersiten Homeri essequam caventi Achillem, which
does not look as if hewas so bad ajudge oi poetry as Horace
represents him to have been. Alexander was not only the pupil
os Aristode, but also himself an enthusiastic student oi Homer:
possibly, asschiitz thinks, Horace’s low estimate ot his critical
powers was simply due· to the lact thatmthere was uo good
poem extant oi which he was the theme.

neele. The right oi coining gold was always reserved to
themselves by the kings os Macedon, as by the kings oi Persia
aud afterwards by the Romans: while subject states and dis·
tricts were osten permitted to coin silver (cp. Gardner’s Greek
Ceius, p. 26): and there may probably be a reference to this
here: cp. our sover'eign, and δαρεικός, which is apparently derived
not from Darius, hurliom the Persian dard, ‘king ’. The coins
oi Philip hadon' one side a head oi Ares, on the other a chamot,
not as som‘e editors say the king³s head (Gardner, . 188). There
is no distance oi a realistic portrait of au earlier time than
Alexander (ib. p. 175).

nonatum this is the earliest instance in which this purely
Greek word occurs in Latin: Martial has it several times.

Philippos: the Philippeum th'lr'ppeus (with or without num·

the Persian darios, which had up to ‘his time been the gold·
coinage most widely current in Greece, probably asa preparation
