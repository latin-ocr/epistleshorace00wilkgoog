Cicero (in Pis. 16, 37) addresses Piso as Epicure noster, ex hara
producte, non ex schola. The character of Epicurus himself was
not open to the charge oi undue indulgence in sensual pleasures.
Cp. Aelian Var. Hist. tv. 13, ‘Epicurus the Gargettian cried
aloud aud said “To whom a little is not enough, nothing is
enough. Give me a barley·cake aud water, and I am ready to
vie even with Zeus in happiness.’‘’

EPISTLE V.

The Torquatus who is here addressed is doubtless the one

addressed in Carm. tv. 7. 23, where Horace mentions his ι

eloqueuce.a suitable compliment sor an advocate (l. 31). But
it is difficult to identify him with any one oi the names
known to his . There was aL. Manlius Torquatus, consul
iu the year morlines birth: his son was killed in Africa
in nc. 48 (Cic. Brut. 76, 26„ Bell. Afric. 96), buthe may
have leit a son ol about the same age as Horace: this how-

C. Nonius Asprenas, ou whom Augustus conferred the sumame
Torquatus with the right to wear a gold chain, out os sympathy
t'or an accident which he had met with in the ‘Trojan gume,
(so Dict. Biog.); but if young enough to have taken part in the
Trojan garne when revived by Augustus (not apparently belore
tac. 28), he is not likely to have been so intimate with Horace.
It is best to assume that he was some Manlius Torquatus, not
otherwise known. There is nothing to determine the date oi
the Epistle unless we accept Ritter’s interpretation of l. 9, which
would place it definitely in the summer of B. e. ao: but it must
have been written at least a year or two, probably somewhat
more, aiter the second consulship of Statilius Taurus in tac. ab.
