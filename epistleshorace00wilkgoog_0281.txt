to ‘hot' or to ‘cold'l As the word properly denotes a mild
warmth, it is found sometimes in one sense, sometimes in the
other, but the former is much the more commone cp. however
Ep. 1. 18, 93. In Carm. 11. 6, 17 tepidasque praebet Iuppiter
brumas and Sat. 11. 3, ιο si vacuum tepula cepisset villula tecto,
the notion suggested is that of a comfortable warmth z in Sat. 1.
3, 81 tepidum ius is ‘sauce half-cold’. The same force attaches
to tepea in Sat Ι. 4, 30 (sol) qua vespertina tepet regri, and in Ep.

ceding calet. Hence we must decidedly reject Macleane's ‘heat
of the day’ and Conington’s ‘summer alternoons’, and find
some time when the sun has already lost something of its beat.
Orchi argues for the time towards evening, quoting Mart. tv„ 8,
7 kara libellorum decim est, Euphrate, mearum: (we may add
Mart. x. 19, 18 seras tutior ibis ad lacernas. Haec lora est tua,
cum furit Lyaeus, cum regnat rosa, cum malem capilli) sup·

citing the poems it contained. But Martial is intentionally dis·
timet&tltltt{lnnntltnolttlttllthtttl l}
reason to suppose that evening was the time usually chosen for
public recitatione. If we accept this interpretation of sol tepidus
it is better to think, with Kriiger, of the loiterers round the shop
of the Sosii, who would be more numerous in the evening than
at any other time: cp. Horace‘s description of his own practice
in Sat. 1. 6, 1¹3· There is plenty of authority for this use of sal
as marking a part of the day: cp. Sat. 1. 4, 30: Sat. 1. 6‚125:
Sat. 11. 4, 23· But others suppose that Horace is still regarding
his book as a schoolmaster; and that sol tepr'dus refers to the
cooler days aster the holidays (Sat. 1. 6, 75, with Palmer's note),
when the schools would be full agaim or, as some again say,
to the milder weather aster the spring holidays. In that case he
would be giving a gloomy prophecy that few but schoolboys
would read his poems. This is barely in keeping with the tone
of the following part of the letter, which is much better fitted
to be addressed to the general public than to boys using the
poems as a first reading-book„ The scholiasts were fairly
uzzled by the line, and write sheer nonsense. Comm. Cruq.
‘cum plures coeperint te legere et audire: secundum morem
librariorum loquitur, qui circa quartam vel quintam horam
dictata pueris praebere consueverunt, qua tempore sunt tracta·
liliores’. Another has ‘tunc enim dictata accipiunt pueri, cum
beneficio solis cera facilius deletur'. But why in either case
girum? Another explains sol tepidus as populares fava. Per·
ps the simplest explanation after all is Ritter’s, who takes
it to mean ‘when the weather is neither too hot nor too cold
