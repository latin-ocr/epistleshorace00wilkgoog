te. Archilochum: Ep. 1. 19, 23-25 (notes) lambo. the
word ἴαμβος rs undoubtedl derived from ἰατττωί to fling’ (Curt.
Ιίἰρννι.δ 537, E T. 11 154l, and denotesoriginallyaflinging, or
a verse flung at another, whence ἰαμβίζιν“ to lampoon’. When
Aristotle Poet v. 6says os Crates πρῶτος ἦρξ εν ἰιφέμενος τῆς
ἰαμβικῆς ἰδέας καθόλου ποιεῖν λόγους κα ἰμύθους he refers to the
changde from the mere abuse of the earliest stages to a regular
comey.

8⁰. ςοααί, Ep. 11. 1, 174. Comedy' rs mentioued before
tragedy, though later in origin„ or at any rate, later in reaching
literary development, perhaps as being more akin in subject to
the satire oi Archilochus Mr Mahaffy thinks that we cannot
what metre was used by Thespis, ior the recitations with
{ilion he separated the choral parts os the earliest tragedies κ
(1. ο34)ι butas the next tragic poet Phrynichus used iambic

trimeters, while it is expressly said that he wast the first to ’

introduce trochaic tetrameters in tragedy‚ although nothing of
the kind' rs said about his use of iambics‚ it is pretty clear that “
the latter must have been used hy Thespis. Yet Aristotle Poetics
tv. 18 says τό τε μέτρον ἐκ τετραμέτρου ἰαμβεῖον ἐγένετο, as
though the earliest tragedres had been 111 tetrameters: cp. Rhet.
111. 19 (below) F our or five iambic lines, ascribed to Susarion,
the reputed introducet os comedy' rrrtot At hens from Megara, are
preserved, but they are not genuine. Comedy can hardly be
said to have taken literary ionn before the time of Cratinus,
and he used iambies largely‚ though not exclusively. Bergk
however (G.L.111. 107) thinks that the use of iambics was
even earlier in comedy than in tragedy. Undoubtedly the
reason sor the choice oi this metre is that given by Horace,
that it comes nearest to the ordinary rhythm of prose. Cp.
Arist. Rhet. 111. 8, 4 ὁ δ’ ἰαμβος αὐτή έοτιν 7 λέξις ητῶν τολλιίν·
διο μάλιστα πάντων τῶν μέτριον ἰαμβεῖα φθέγγονται λέγοντες. So
in 111 1, 9 he speaks os tragic poets who έκ τῶν τετραμέτρον
εἰς τὸ ἰαμβεῖον μετέβηοαν διὰ τὸ τῳ λόγῳ τοῦτο τῶν νμέτρων ομοιό-
τατον εἰναι ταν ἄλλων, and 111 the Poetics lv· 18 he says μάλιστα
γὰρ λεκτικὸν τῶν μέν τρων τὸ ἰαμβεῖόν ἐστι· σημεῖον δὲ τούτου
πλεῖστα γὰρ ἰαμβεῖα λέγομεν έν τῃ διαλέκτῳ τῃ πρὸς αλλήλουςῐ

coturuh All MSS. have coturni here and everywhere 111
Horace, and, asKeller says (Eprl on Carrn. 11. r, ra),’ 111 every
author who has been caresullycollated. Cp. eg. Riese praes.
Ovid. 1 ..p xiii. Certainly all MSS. .giue it so 111 Quintil x 1,
68 and ru Propert. 11 1(1.1 ()4 ᾗ, ,,41 while Nettleship adopts it in
Vergil, eg ..Ecl vm. 104. ere is therei ore no reason to doubt
that this gform sor κόθορνοι had est tablished itself 111 popular
usage. But cp. .Ribbeck Proll.' 111 Verg. p. .4,24 where he shows
that the evidence' rs divided.
