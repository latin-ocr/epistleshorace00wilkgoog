ὖ. flaua prima: the fig ripens towards the end of August
and the beginning of September; cp.Carm.111. 23, 8 pomifero
grave ternpus anno. There were also early spring figs‚ formed
even before the leaves (cp. Plin. xit. 18, 71 sunt praeterea eaedem
serotinae et praecoces, biferae, alba ac nt'gra, curra merse vinde·
rm'aque maturescentes ,· xvt. 26, 113; Meyer on Matth. xxi. 19,
Trplnch Mirocles, p. 451), but these are of course not referred
to ere.

6. &amtorem this form is the only one recognized

by good MSS. aud by inscriptions. Cp. E . 1. 5, 16. The
dissignator was the man who marshalled the linerat procession,
not the dominusfuneris of Cic. de Leg. 11. 24, 61 dominusque
sunnis utatur accenso atque lictoribus (as Macleane says), but
one of his accensi (cp. lilarquardt lfrivatalt. 1. 357 note). &⁰¹¹
aalma :t ‘tertrametro
serantur. The name was also given to the officials who assigned
places in the theatro: ep. Plaut. Poen. prol. 18...neu lictor
verbum out virgae martioni, neu dissignator praeter os obam-
bulet, neat sessum ducat, dum histrio in scaena siet, whence it
is clear that the lictoris here used generally for ‘attendant ’ζ

slusa oc.

d. l. tpuerla: cp. Mart. x, 62, ra aestate pueri si valent, satis

8. officiosa ‘in showing attentions': for «ficia in the sense of
the duties of cirility due from clients and from citizens generally

ing solutatio, the deductio in forum, visits to the sick, attendance

at ffifflffign funerals, or when the toga virilis was assumed,
an e e.

opella ‘petty business’: cp. Ep. 11. a. 67. The word occurs

a. umente namnat ‘unseals wills’, ie. causes deaths.

A will was usually written on tablets of wood or wax3 a senatus·

· consultum (of the time of Nero, Suet. Ner. 17) enacted that they
were to be tied up with a triple thread, and then wax was to be
put over the thread and scaled by the testator, and also by wit·
nesses When scaled a will was deposited with some friend, or
in a temple, or with the Vestal virgins. After the testator's
death as many of the witnesses as possible were collected, and

‘ after they had acknowledged their seals‚ the thread was broken,

and the will read. Cp. Huschke Jurispr. Anteiust. p. 538.⁴
