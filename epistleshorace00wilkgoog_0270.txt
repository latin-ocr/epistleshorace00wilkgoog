²30 HORATI EPISTULAE.

the more famous by far, so that it could be named by Cicero and
Persius without any qualifying epithet.

11. nocturno-diurno. This line curiously resembles in ’

rhythm A. P. 269 Nocturna versate mana, versate diuma5 it
has even been supposed to contain a parodying reference to it,

which is just possible, if we accept with Prof. Nettleship the ¹

earliest date assigned to the Ars Poetica. For olere v. 5
Horace substitutes the stronger word putere: cp. Mart. 1. 29
Hesterno sedere mero qui credit Acerram, fhlldur: r'n lacem
semper Acerra bibit. The epithet diurno is not however quite
correctly attached here to the wine: the meaning is ‘they stink
all day of the wine which they vie with each other in drinking at
night ‚ not, asin Martial, that they sit up drinking into the next
day. Cp. Carm. Ν. 1, 31 nee amare iuvat mem ‘to join the
drinking bout’ Pege.

12 pede nudo: Plutarch says of Cato of Utica (c. vl)
πολλάκις ἀνυπόδητος tal ἀχίτων ets vt initiator προῄει μετ’ dptrror,
and in c. 1. speaks of the firm and immoveable expression of his
face. Some have thought that Horace is referring here rather to
the elder Cato, douhting whether he would have ventured to
choose Caesar's bitter enemy as his type of virtue, and reminding
us that the younger was himself only an imitator of the elder.
But Carm. 1. ro, 35 Catonis nobile letum seems answer enough
to the first: to the second we may reply that it is far more iu
harmony with the context to understand a contemporary as the
object of imitation, than one who had died more than a century
before. Cp. Mommsen Hist. Ιν. 156. ‘A strange caricature of
his ancestor...he even formed a school, and there were individuals
-it is true they were hut a few—who iu their turn copied and
caricatured afresh the living pattem of a philosopher ’. Cic. ad
Art. 11. r, ιο speaks of Servilius as Catoms aemulator, and often
mentions Favonius, who we leam from Dio xxxvm. ywas
called the ‘ape of Cato’: Mommsen applies to the latter the
hardly less uncivil phrase ol' Cato’s Sancho (ιν. 315). Cp. the
proverb ‘cucullus non facit monachum '.

’ 13. tenum, if takenasakind of instrumental ablative (soe ,
on v. 3) needs no correction. ¹

in loudness of voice and fluency of speeeh3 but this is quite
inconsistent with urbanus. It seems rather that he brought
himself into trouble by imitating the bitter wit of Timagenes·
