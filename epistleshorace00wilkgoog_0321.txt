Bir. ΙΙ. Ep. t] Nom ' 181

Plin. Ν. H. vm. 18, 17 Cannlopardale's ducatoris Caesaris Gir·
censibus ludis (Β. c. 46) primum uisa Rornae.

198. etenum 11111111 white elephants are proverbially very
rare, being really albinoes. Even the famous white elephants
of Siam seem to be really of a slate colour. Cp. ‘Daily N ews’
sor Jan. 31, 1884. The form in ans is that be'st supported
here, though doubtless the n was not pronounced: but cp.

Brambach Lat. Orthogr. p. 267, Roby ἕ 495, S. G. 5166.-

Bentley's ccccvenerit has very slight support, and would hardly

be defensible, isit had more.

ἒ tut. tuu1s1nete=quam ludos ipsos: Sat. 1. 1, 97 se nan
ξ unquamserua melius vestiret: Verg. Aen. 1. 15 quarn Iunc fertur

tems reads amnibus unarn caluisse. This usage withanadverb

seems limited to poets: cp. Ktihner Gramm. 11. 976.

198. nimio appears to have decidedly more authority than
the vulgate mima, the vet. Bland. being here supported by some
of Keller's best MSS. It isalso the reading which is apparently,
though not really, the harder, sor it is doubtful whether mimus
can be used, as Orelli says ‘proquovis histrione ’‚ and it is not
easy to see why Horace should not have used the plural for the
actors on the stage. For plus nimia cp. note on Ep. t. 10, 30.

199. usello surdo: Horace has packed two proverbial ex·
pressioris into one, sor the sake of greater emphasis: cp. Ter.
Haut. 111 nc ille nauscit qnam milri nunc surda narretfabulam,
aud Zenob. v. 41 ὄνῳ τις ἔλεγε μῦθον· 1 δὲ τὰ ὦτα ἐκίνει· eir

ἀναισθησίαν τινῶν ἡπαροιμλα εἴρηται.

101. limum: Carm. 11. 9, 6aquilanibns querceta Gargani
laborant. The iorests oi Garganus have now almost entirely
disappeared, 11 is also the case very largely in the Apennines.

103. ludi, 1 term equally applicable to the ludi scaenici and
to the ludi circenses, so that we need not suppose with Orelli
any reference to the latter. 11111 ‘works oi art': Ep. 1. 6, 17.

m oblitus ‘bedizened'3 Mr Yonge compares Milton's
‘besmeared with gold’ in Par. L. v. 356. The word is used in
the sense of ‘overloaded’ in ad Her. iu. rr, 16 si crebrae
conlocabuntur [exomationes], oblitam reddent arationem; Cic.
Brut. 13, 51 eloquentia...ita peregrinata est tata Ana, nt se
externis oblineret monitis: so that Eckstein's conjecture absitus,
though neat, is needless.

apat pene emphasizing nil: ‘not a word'. Cic de Orat. 11.
1, 5 no e.

107. veneno ‘drug’, i. e. dye. Τ111 purple (nccerex) oi Ta·
rentum was considered second only to that oi Tyre (Ptin. tx. 39,-
