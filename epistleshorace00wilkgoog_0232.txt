‘ repemina meansimply‘warms’a's ofteninLucretiusvapor
means ‘heat’ (cp. v. 1131); but perhaps it is better to interpret
prith Orelli ‘tepido vapore obdneat'.

' 8. qnid, urant, semitas. The subl. pres. does nothere
suggest that the hypothesis is merely imaginary, but ferant is
attracted into the mood of dias: ‘if you were to learn this, you
¹would say ’, dte. Bentley reads ferunt end iamet, which would
he necessary if delas did not sollotv, suggestinf the same form to

be supplied alter quii. Macleaue’s comma a ter umbra, instead

ol a note of interrogation, makes the construction unintelligible.
Prot. Palmer believes the true reading to be quid qnod here and

d for si in v. 9: quod then fell out alter quid in v. 8, and

ore quercus in v. 9. Several good MSS. omit si aud have α
in v. 9, aud some have quodsi here, which tacu seem to point to
some corruption. Certainly quid si as it stands here, seems
quite unparalleled. In that case, we must of cotnse read semet.

hanlcnl hes better authority, and is more poetical than
bcnrgm: some MSS. have bcnlgrm: Lucretius w. 60 uses
uprisasafeminine, and Priscian (v. 8. 42) says that the gender
was common with ‘vetustissimi’ 3 but Vergil (Georg.111.444‚
Aen. v111. 645) and Columella treet it as masculine. Munro

,thinks that the evidence points to the femininelhere (note on ,
Lucreti e) though he pnnts bemgm. Cp. beazgnus ager Or. t

Am. 1.1c‚ 56.
