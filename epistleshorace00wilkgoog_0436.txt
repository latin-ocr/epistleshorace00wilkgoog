slight authority and is only a gloss.

319. speciosa loeta: loci has two chief meanings in rhetoric:
(r) ‘common·places'‚ ie. passages of abstract exposition or
discussion, which can be introduced in any place where they
may suit the context, but which are not limited to any particular
occasion: (a) ‘topics’ or ‘sources’ from which arguments may
be derived, or ‘beads’ under which they may be arranged. The
word is very commori in Cicero’s rhetorical writings in both
senses: cp. note on Cic. de Orat. 1. 13, 56, where the loci deal
with such subjects as the gods, piety, friendship, justice, and the
like. In Quintilian’s time the former meaning was the more
usual, aud he‘sometimes sollows it, eg. vn. r, 41 plerique...
conteuti sum locis speciosis modo vel nillil ad probationem cou-
smnlibus: but sometimes he returns to the other meaning, v.
ro, 20 locos appello nou ut uulgo nunc intelleguntur, in lmuriom
et adulterium et similia, red sedes argumentorum iu quibus Ιαίεηί,

the opposite interpretation ‘colligit saepe magis placuisse fabu-
lnm, quae nudis narraretur verbis, quoniam res spectatorem
delectarent, quam quae locis communibus explicaretur’. If he ‚
had our text, he must have taken vorsus inopes rerum=loci
communes, the latter phrase having acquired by bis time some·
thing of that notion of triteness and leebleness which attaches
to our owp ‘common-place remark‘, but not to a ‘common-

nominaremus does not add a quite distinct idea, but develops
the first. ‘Sometimes a play, isit is vivid in its way ol dealing
with characters, and paints them aright, even though it has no
grace (Ep. 1.6, 38), from its lack of weightyand artistic language,
gives more pleasure to the people, and keeps their attention
better than liues which baveno substance and melodious trifles’.
Schiitz takes as an.example those characters in Shakspere which
are always lile-like, even when there is something repugnant to
our taste in the language which they use. Certainly if a play
has at once brilliant passages and true pictores of chmacter, rt
