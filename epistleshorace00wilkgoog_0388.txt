But although Julius Caesar intended to attempt this work (Suet.
Jul. xum), and perhapsmet with some partial success, reclaim·

poorer citizens (Dio. va. 9), there is no evidence that it was
carried out by Augustus: and Mr Long (Notos on Plutarch Caes.

antea per Velabrum fluebat, and similar notes are given by
Acron and Comm. Cruq. But the Velabrum was drained by the
Cloaca Maxima in the time of the kings, and the Tiber never
flowed through it. Suet. Aug. xxx. says oo' coercendas inun-

mind of Horace. But the three instances of great works of men
here mentioned as perishing are strikingly parallel to what Plut.
Caes. Lvm. says of the schemes os Julius Caesar: ‘He had also
a design of diverting the Tiber, and carrying it by a deep chan·
nel directly from Rome to Circeii, and so into the sea near Tar-
racina, that there might be a safe aud easy passage for all mer·
chants who traded to Rome. Besides this he intended to drain
all the marshes by Pomentium and Setia, and gain ground
enough from the water to employ many thousands of men in
tillage. He proposed further to make great mounds on the
shore nearest Rome, to hinder the sea from breaking in upon
the land, to clear the coast at Ostia of all the hidden rocks and
shoals that made it unsafe for shipping, and to form ports and
harbours fit 10 receive the large number of vessels that would
frequent them. These things were designed without being car·
ried into effect‘. Now it seems pretty clear, that the dreining of .
the Pomptine marshes was never carried out to an extent suffi-
cient to justify Horace’s language, if taken strictly. There is
great probability therefore in the view of Preller (Aussdtre,
p. 515 ff.) that Horace has in view throughout the designs of
Julius rather than any works actually executed by Augustus. It
would be a very doubtful compliment to the reigning emperor to
take great engineering operations of his as instances of works
doomed to pass away; whereas it would be natural for him 10
speah thus of gigantic sehemes commenced a quanter of a cen·
tury before and never completely carried out. We must there·¹
fore suppose Horace to be using a kind of poetic anticipati0n‚
‘assuming the great dictator’s plens to have been achieved.
