Towards the end 01 the reign oi Augustus a Municipium Au·
gustum Veiens was established on the old site, and continued to
exist at least for three or four centuries. Isola Farnese does not,
as Orelli says, mark the site 01 Veii, but is separated from it by
a deep ravine. Cp. Dennis, Cities and Camelaria ιγ’ Etruria

grammarian (Agroec. p. 2274 Ρ.) explains adsita arbor est, cui

tauers: both the word and the tense have caused much diffi-
culty to the critias. Bentley adopts the reading of some inferior
MSS. refigit, which he takes as equivalent to resolvit, without
