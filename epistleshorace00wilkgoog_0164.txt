has similarly invideor in Α. Ρ. 56. The idiom is a colloquial one‘.
I think Orelli is wrong in supposing idoneus as well as imperor
to. be connected with procurare.

22. turps=w0rn and faded. toral, ‘coverlet’ placed upon
the tori, as in Petron. 40 adornemur neiaistri ac torale'a proposue-
ἷζέέγίιὲνᾊερ. Sat. 11. 4, 84. For the form cp. capital, cervical,

23. comet narls ‘make you turn up your nose'indis·
gust. Quint. x1. 3, 80 names this among other movements of
the nose and lips which he considers indecorous.

ne nou...ostenust ‘that.,.fail not to show you '.

25. eliminet ‘cany abroad '‚ aword used inthe early poets ina
literal sense, and here in a somewhat more extended application:
cp. Pomponius in Non. p. 38 vos istic monete: eliminabo extra
aeder coniugem, and other dramatists there quoted, and Quint.
vm. 3, 31 nam memini mamis admodum inter Pomponium et
Senecam etiam praefationibus esse tractatum on ‘gradus eliminat'
in tragoedia dici oportuisset. The force of the English derivative
seems to be due to mathematicians of a later age. Cp. the
quotation in Mart. t. ay, 7 (probably from some drinking song)

26. iungaturque part: sor as Seneca (Ep. xix.) says, ana
conspiciendum cum quibus edas et bibas, quom quid edas et bibas.
sutram...sept1uumqus, quite unknown persons, although the
names are found elsewhere, the former in an inscription (of
doubtful genuineness), the latter several times both iu inscriptions
and in literature. Bentley first restored the true forms for the
corrupt Brutum...Septimiumque. Orelli is too hard upon them
in comparing them with Mulvius et scurrae of Sat. 11. 7, 3⁶3
they were plainly friends of Torquatus.

27. cena pnor,‘ an earlier engagement ἐ pauorque puella ‘a
girl whom he prefers': -que appears here to have the force of
coupling alternatives, which are regarded as both acting to pre·
vent his presence, though not together: hence it is virtually dis·
junctive, as in Verg. Georg. 11. 87, 139, 312, 111. rar (Conington),
and often in Lucretius (cp. Munro's index): the engagement is
not necessarily to the puella, though it may be. Martin rightly
renders ‘unless he be engaged elsewhere or flirting with some
girl whom he prefers to any company ‘.

28. adsumam, ‘Iwill have S. too ’r itis a striking proof of
the mechanica] and careless way in which our MSS. were copied,
that Keller quotes only one as having this, the unquestionably

correct readings all his others have ad suotmam, or some cor·
raphon ot that reading.
