326 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

· anquatrlhus', the ‘spring holidays', which were observed
not only iu schools, hut as general festivities, from March ¹9

to March 23· Ovid (Fast. 111. 809, 810 fiunt saera Mimas, ’

nomina qaae eunctis quinque diebus habent) derives the name

from the iact that me holiday extended over five days: but ¹
Festus (p. 254 M,), by quoting fonns like Triatrus, Sexatrus, l

etc. shows that the word was applied originally only to the
first day of the festival, and that it denotes the fifth day after
the Ides. Cp. Mayor on Juv. x. 115 totr's Quinquatribus mat.

199. domus. Bentley attacked this reading, asinconsistent
with the metap‘hor of a ship in the next liue One MS. of no
great excellence repeats procul which Bentley gladly accepted.
But this repetition, thou hcommon enough in passages of earnest
and impressive diction fag. Verg. Aen. VI. 258 procul o procul
este prffani: Ov. Fast. 11. 623, Metam. vm. 589 etc.) is not
well suited to the quiet tone of Horace here. Some Mss. of
the third class omit doinus and absit (not, as Bentley supposed,
domus only): but this is clearly due to an accident, and does

not justify the suspicion of Orelli and others that the genuine ]

word has been lost, and that donitas is due only to conjecture.

Meineke approved the conjecture modo, but in Horace we ,

always find midli‘and that only after dum or si. This difficulty

is avoided by Jeep’s conjecture, adopted by Kriiger, mode ut ᾗ

procul. No satisfactory substitute for dm has been proposed,
and the word is in itself not indefensible, although Macleane
says ‘it has no meaning here'· There is nothing metaphorical
in this line, and consequently no clashing of metaphors. We

may fairly assume, with Ritter, that pauperies immundo domus l

represents pauperies immundae domus (cp. Carm.111. 1, 4e)r
Horace goes back in thought to the costly ornaments of the
house mentioned in vv. rso-182, and says that all these may
well be spared: provided the straitened means are not such as

. to produce sordid surroundings, a man's lodging makes no

more difference to himself than the size of a ship would, in
which he might happen to be sailing.

*utinm-an. This is at first sight a startling substitution of
the dependent double interrogative for the alternative hypo·
thesis stne-sive. But it is to he explained by supposing that

some expression like nihil distat was present to the mind of ³

Horace, for which he afterwards substituted ferar unus et riiem.
Hand (Tursell. 1. 302) quotes Ov. Rem. Am. 797 Daunius an
Libycis bulbus tibi missus ab oris, an veniat Megaris, marias
omnis erit, where the explanation is similar. ¹In F ast. 111. 779
Ovid uses an as parallel to sive...sive, where we have a transition
from alternative hypotheses to a direct question. This leads
the way to the interchange of the two, as in Tac. Ann. xr. 26
