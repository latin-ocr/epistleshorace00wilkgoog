much to establish the text oi Homer in the middle of the second
century tac. His merits were first shown by the publication oi
the Venetian Scholia on Homer by Villoison in 1788. They
have been discussed best by F. A. Wolf in his famous Prolegomena‚
by Lebrs dc Aristarchi Studiis Homericis (ed. 3, 1882), and by
Pierron in his edition of the Iliad. There is no reason to suppose
that he was unduly severe, though he was strict in his critical
principles. Pope (Duucr'ad lv. 203) calls Bentley ‘that awlul

more obscure: the explanation oi Celsus that it is so called
because the yellowish tinge caused by it reminds one oi the
colour oi the rainbow (arcus caelestis> is not very satisfactory. ³
Jaundice is not at all contagious: perhaps the notion that it was
