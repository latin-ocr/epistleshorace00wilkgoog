bt. laum murus ab imo, a difficult phrase. Horace (Sat.

11. 3, 18) speaks of antedius Ianus at which a man’s fortune
was wrecked: and Cicero (de Off. 11. 24, 87) of those who sit
ad medium Ianum, plyiug their business as bankers irc. In
Phil. vl. 5, 15 he makes ,mention oi a statue erected L. An·
tonia a medio Iano patrono, and adds Itane? Ianus medius in
L. Antonii clientela est? Quis unquam in illu Iano r'ttventus

therefore that mediuslanus was equivalent to our 'Change; but
it is not certain'what the precise meaning of Janus was. Becker
(Rom. Alt. 1.p. 326), followed by Mr Burn (Rome and the Cam·
pagna, p. 105) supposes that three or more Iani stood at various
oints alo the north-east side of the Forum, similar to the
lanus Qua rifrons which still stands in the Forum Boarium,
constructed oi four archways, joined in a square, withan attr'ca
or a chamber above them. He thinks that ὼε bankers spoken
of by Horace aud Cicero transacted their business partly in
these chambers, and partly below under the archways It has
even been suggested that the foundations of the medius Ianus
have been discovered. But the scholiast of Cru uius says ‘Ianus
autem hic platea dicitur, ubi mercatores et feneratores sortis
causa convenire solebant'3 and certainly Ianus is osten used
in the sense oi an moade or passage, rather than an arch.
Hence Dr Dyer in Dict. Geogr. 11. 774b conjectures that
lanus was the name applied to the street at the north side of
the forum, a view supported at some length by Mr Nicholls in
his ‘Roman Forum', p. 240 fs. If this view be correct (and
it has the support of Bentley), we must translate ‘the whole
