294 HORATI EPISTULAE.

at habenae} in'the last, it goes on the end ol v. 16. The decisiou
between these interpretations depends mainly on the reading
adopted as the last wordin the line. The great majority of MSS.
heve laedat, but the aet. Bland. has laedit. Is we adopt the
latter, with Bentley, Meineke‚ Munro, Ritter, Haupt, and
L. Miller, it seems best to take der as jussive‚ and as said by
the vendor: ‘let me have the money, il the fact which 1 have
mentioued, that he once ran away, does not trouble you ’. (Cp.
Roby ξ 1575, S. G.§ 657 (by.) Itis however quite possible, with
Schiitz, to render ‘should you give him the money, assuming that
you are not troubled ’‚ &e (Roby§ 1569, S. G. g 653), ‘then he
would carry off his priae'. He argues that this is made necessary
by the fact that the vendor whois desiring to minimioe theslave's
offence, would not return to it again, and use such a hard word
about it as suga, when he had already said enough about it to
satisly the requirements of the law. There is something in this
argument, but it is hardly strong enough to make us force upon
Horace so awkward a construction, as that which is involved in
supposing three conditional clauses, in successive subordination
(si quis vere-(si) des-si laedit), to precede our epodosis. 1f we
read laedae it is theu almost necessary to accept the first view,
and to put the line into the mouth os Horace ‘you would give
him the money, supposing you were not to be troubled’, ue.

fem is then added by asyndeton, as a second apodosis. The ¹

great probability that laedit, if the original reading, would have
been assimilated by copyists to the neighbouring subjunctivesis
enough to make us decide in its favour.

est in some MSS. is placed before tui, in others aster ribi, in
others at the end of the line, in others it is omitted altogether.
Probably the original reading was tibist ,· and the est was written
over it, and afterwards introduced in various places (Keller).
Seh'utz has shown that it could not well be omitted here, between

two verbe each in the second person. ,
