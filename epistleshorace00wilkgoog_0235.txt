pono: Horace uses the first person here only ιιι order‘ to
avoid the apparent invidiousness os the second. The fact that
he himself never stood sor any office conserred by popular

person, connecting rt with mordear, and putting afull stop, not
anote oi mtcrr tion, at colores. His notion of the drist of the

shouldalsobestungb charges however gronndless He rightly
sees that the salnes nor and the mendax ans samia affect the
same man. But Horace’s point seems rather to be that as false
charges would not effect the man, in whose position he rs io‘r the
moment plac himself, so an unsounded reputation for virtue

ought not to elight him. Hence idem rs best taken with
