9. fitius may possibly have been a son of M. Titius, the
consul suffectus in the year of the battle at Actium, where
he held a high command. The account given by the scholiasts
does not add much to our knowledge: Acron says that he tried
to transfer the prosonnd thought and eloquence of Pindar into
Latin, and wrote tragedies and lyrics, of little value: Porphyrion
adds that he was very learned. All this may well be derived
from the text. The Comm. Cruq. says that his name was Titius
Septimius, and that there was a remarkable monument to him
below Aricia ε the first part of this statement cannot be right, for
we baveno instance as early as this ol the combination of two
gentile names, like Titius and Septimius. Cp. note on Ep. 1.
