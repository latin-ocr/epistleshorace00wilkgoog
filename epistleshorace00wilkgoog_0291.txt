writes (Rome and tlte Camagora, p. 218) ‘The worship of
, Egeria was probably indigenous to the grove of Diana at Aricia,
where we find that there was a shrine and fountain of Egeria3
whence it rrlay have been transferred by Numa (l) to the valley

and fountain outside the Porta Capena! Egeria was one of the
Camenae, and while we read of the Vallis Egeriae, the grove
with the temple in it is spoken of as the Lucus Camenarum
(Becker Rbm. Alterth. 1. 513—515). If therefore the Camenae
were worshipped at Aricia, it would be natural enough to speak
of them as uttering their primitive poetry on the mountain which
rose above their grove, especially or those who remembered the
muse-haunted Helicon and Parnassus. We may compare Quintil.

28-33. It is absurd to argue tuat because tto oldest Greek
writers arc tbe best, it is so also at Rome.

28. firmorum: so Bentley with the vet. Bland. and some
few other MSS. Most MSS. have Graecorum.

2⁹. vomantur, very rarely used in this primary sense ol
‘weigh', and not in its derived meaning of ‘repay’ by any
writer earlier than Horace.

³1. olea, Bentley’s correction for oleam of almost all MSS.
has met with very general acceptance. It seems impossible to

· suppose that intra is a preposition, while extra is so evidently an

adverb. It isnecessary then to supply in to govern olea rom
the following in mue, precisely as cum above in vel Gabiis
