probably spurious. For the construction cp. Ep. 1. 1, 133 18, 58 3
19, 26; 58; 11. r, 208.

28. Gautuber: Dio Cass. Liv. 11 τούς τε ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ πάντας
ὀλίγον διέφθειρε καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς τά τε ὅπλα ἀφείλέτο καὶ ἐς τὰ πεδία
ἐκ τῶν ἐρυμνῶν κατεβίβασεν. This was in B‚C· uo, although the
campaign was not closed till uc. 19. Cp. Merivale iv. 120.

2'1. menius. Τ111 submission of Armenia to Tiberius had
been a bloodless one. Cp. Tac. Arm. 11. 3. At the request of
the Armeniaus Augustus had sent to them Tigranes, a prince
who had been living in exile at Rome, to take the place of a
king whom they had dethroned and nrurdered. For the various
coins of Augustus, bearing the legend Auruurtlu Curru, cp.
Mommsen Mon‘. Ancyr. p. 77. Orelli refers also to one having
a figure of Armenia on bendedknee,but1 have not been able to
venfy his reference.

Pramus ¹is the spelling of the better MSS.= Phraates has
much less authority, both here and in Carm. 11. 2,17. The
Mon. Ancyr. V. 54, vi. 1. 4 has Phrates.

28. genibus mluor=srqtplem genibus is to be referred to
Prahates ‘inferior by his (bendedl knees’, ie. thus testifying his
humbied position, not, as apparently Orelli, at the knees of
Caesar. There is something of exaggeration here too, although
Tacitus (Ann. 11. 1) says cruncta venerantium (ficia ad Augustum
verterat, and in the Mon. Ancyr. (p. 84 Momms.) Augustus says
Parthos trium exercituum Romanorum spolio et siguo reddere uu'lu'
supplicesque amicitiam populi Romani petere coegi. Horace refers
to these surrendered standards again in Ep. 1. 18, 56; Carm. lv.
15, 6; Ovid in Trist. 11. ²27 and Fast. vr. 465.

29. defundit: the present seems to point to the time of
writing as that of late summer in ue. 20. The perfect defudit
has less support, andis due to awrong assimilation to cecidit and
accepit: diffundit or diffudit have but slight authority and are
not so suitable in meaning here. It is neediess to suppose with
Ritter that this letter was written in the summer of uc. 19. There
would have been time enough for news os the successes in Spain
and the East in uc. ao to reach ¹Rome before the end of the
summer: and Ep. 1. 3, 3 does not necessarily implythat it was
winter when Horace wrote that letter.
