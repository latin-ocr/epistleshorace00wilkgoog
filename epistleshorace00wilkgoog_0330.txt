EPISTLE II.

The Flonrs of this epissseb the {ulios Florus to whom
Horace addressed the third epaue oft e first book. Now, as
then, he appears attached to the suite of Tiberius Nero. But

while the ate of the former epistle admits of being detennined
precisely, it is less easy to fix the date of the resent. ‘Almost
