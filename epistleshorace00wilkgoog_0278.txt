‚aridaque morsu pumzir‘s aridi politur. Maeleane is wrong here
first in speaking of parchment rolls, instead of papyrus, and
secondly in supposing that the ontside skin was polished with
pumice: the parchment (membrana) used as the wrapp'er of the

note that the book is represented as running away lrom its
master’s house. The asyndeton in non erit reditun is slightly
in savour of Schiitz’s view: it is a little more natural to regard
the appended clause as giving the reason sor what has been said,
than as a cantion to be borne in mind, translating ‘for there
will be’ rather than ‘but remember there will be’. But on
the other hand, as this isa valedictory addxess, and as Horace
in vv. 19 ff. gives his book a commission to discharge, it seems
quite necessary that he should express somewhere his assent,
however reluctantly, to its departure.
