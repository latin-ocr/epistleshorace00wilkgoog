‚mercennarlat all good MSS. here (as usually) give the nn,
where the first n represents the assimilated d of merted, the
second a suffix -ons cp. Roby§ 942, r. The meaning therefore

fienda nefanda (Catull.1.xrv. 405); cp. Cic. Tusc. v. 39, 114,
where there is a series ot such contrasts. In Pers. tit-5 the
phrase isnsed quite differently: see Gildersleeve's note or Con·
mgton.

that Mena needed a kindly hint that it was time for him to go is
‘not required. Like all the compounds of mrito, dimitto osten
