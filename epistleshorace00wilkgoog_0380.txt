me the more correct ’. But 1 cannot but think that Ritter,
Kriiger and Schiitz are right 'in delending imus. It is not
necessary to accept Porph.’s explanation ‘hoc est, in angulo
ludi tabernambabentem’ though ,it may well be founded on a
genuine tradition, as the details which he adds (see below) are
not likely to be mere invention; while Acron’s interpretation of
the word as a proper name is the last refuge of a despairing
commentatorss But I do not see why imus should not have the
natural force of ‘the lowest iu rank ‚ ie. the poorest‚ or most
unskillul. Bentley had oi course no difficulty in showing that
uniaris often used of preeminent excellence (cp. Sat. 1. ro, 4²3
11. 3, 243 6‚. 57); but why is it necessary to suppose that Horace
had in view a particular craltsman, who was distinguished for
his skill in details, but failed in his works as a whole? It is
surely legitimate to say ‘ the poorest smith who lives by the Aemi·
lian school will represent you nails, and imitate waving hair in
bronze’: andis so, there is no reason to depart from the MSS.
Jordan (Hermes, Vol. 1x. 416 ft.) shows that probably around
the outer walls of the ludus there were tabernae, let out to fabri
by the builder or lessee of the school: he thinks that the last of
these facing the main, street was tenanted by the fiaber in ques-
tion under the sign of a figure of Polycletus, which gave rise to
the name by which (according to Porph.) the ludus was aster·
wards known, when turned into a bath (quad num Polycleti
balineum est). If it is not legitimate to take the expression as a
general one, and some particular craltsman is denoted, this view
secius delensible.

‘Fix on some casual sculptor, he shall know
How to give nails their sharpness, hair its flow’. Con.

Orelli seems wrong in regarding elaborate accuracy iu the re·
presentation of the hair as a great merit in a seul tor. After
the path had once been pointed out (according to dliny N. H.
xxxrv. 8, 19 by Pythagoras oi Rhegium: but cp. Overbeck,
Gesch. d. Griccla Plastz'k, p. 183), it was not hard to follow it.

83. mollis ‘waving’, as often in Vergil, eg. Ecl. 111. 45
malli acantho, applied to hair by Tibull 1. 8, 9 quid tibi nunc
mallis prodest coluisse capillos?

84„ menz operta summa ‘failing in his work as a whole ἰ
summa may be best taken as the ablative of the part concemed
(Roby§ raro, S. G. ᾗ 497): Bentley puts a comma after aperr's,
which is then the genitive of the part concerued (Robyd 1320,
S. G. 5 526), a construction which islegitimate enough in its'elt',
but here leaves summa to stand by itsell very awkwardly.
