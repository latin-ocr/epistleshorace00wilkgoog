16-10. Wine has wonderfiael power to open the θιανθ, to ναίει
the spirits and to quickm the wits.

tt. hamunt, unquestionably the right reading, though
Macleane does not even notice it, both as being better supported,
and as the rarer word, end so more likely to be corrupted. Dis·
signare is properly ‘to break the seal’, hence ‘to open’:
it is rightly explained by ‘aperit'‚ in Porphyrion’s note. Prof.
Nettleship (Journal of Phialam x. eoo-8) is of opinion that
the word had acquired the further meaning of ‘ cum nota et igno-
minia aliquid sacere'‚ ιο perform any startling or violent act, any
act which upsets the existing order of things: ‘and this'‚ he adds,
‘is exactly the sense required in the line of Horace, Of what
miracle is not intoxicattbn capablel’ Cp. Plaut. Most. 413, Ter.

Adelph. 87, in both of which places dtisign. should probably be

ι. ιι, 28, and Tac. Hist. ι. 46, iners pro strenuo: hence much
better than inermem, the point being the inspiriting power oi
wine, not the sullies which it can cause. Our ‘Dutch courage '.

lead to an intolerable tautology with disertos.

10. contracta ‘etamped’.
