241. sudet, v. 413, Sat. 1. ro, 28 exsudet causas. Orelli
well quotes Pascal Pensles 1. 3 Les mn'llcurs linres sont ceux
que chaque lectcur croit qu'il auraitpnfnirc: and Wieland says
that·these lines contain ‘one of the greatest mysteries of art,
which Horace could blab very confidently. without searing that
he was betraying anything'to the ἀμνήτοις’. But the mystery
has no special reference to the satyrio drama. >

242. serlw cp. v. 46 in veriti serendis. lunaura v. 48.
'Ihe parallelism gives strong support to those who take carmen
to refer to the language, not to the substance.

243. da medlo sumnus: cp. Cic. Or. 49, 163 verba legenda
sunt...n0n ut poetae exquisz'ta ad sonum sed sumpta demedio:
cp. de Orat. 1. 3, rain rnedio posita, 111. 45, 177 iacentia sustu·
limus e medio. Quint. v, 7, 31 verbis quam rreaxime cx medio
sumptis, ut, qui rogatur, intellegat, ant nc intellegere se neget.
This phrase too may be used οἱ the matter, but is more naturally
taken of the language.

244—260. Is the Fauns use *tlte Iangrnge of tlte streets, the
better class of the audisnce will be offended. «

244. neuneu sc. in scaenam: so Acron rightly explains it.
Paunl, virtually the same as the Satyrs, though corresponding
more exactly to the Πονίοκοι, who along with the Satyrs attended
upon Bacchus. Cp. Ep.1. 19, 4.

245. ne velut innati tusus: the Fauns are not to speak as
if they were natives of the city, and so sall into one of the two
opposite vices of lahguage‚ affected sentimentality, and disgrace-
sul coarseness. It hasbeen supposed that innati triviis and
forenses are opposed to each other, the former denotiug the
vulgar rabble, the latter the more educated men, who could take

art in the business of the law-courts3 in that case there would

a chiarmm, the former referring especially to v. 247, the
latter to v. 246. But there is no sufficient authority ior the force
so assigned to sorensis, and ac would require to be replaced by
aut. ‘Bom in the streets and almost dwellers in the sorum’ is
simply a phrase for townspeople. But there is probably also a
reminiscence of the Greek feeling against spending too much
time in the ἀγορά, cp. ἀγοραῖος, περίτριμμα ἀγορᾶς etc. (Act. Ap.
xvir. 5: Plat. Protag. 347 u: Liv. subrostrani). Cp. factio
sorensis in Liv. rx. 46, 13.· «

248. iuvenentur, a word coined doubtless by Horace, on
the analogy of augurari, auspicari, interpretari, velitari etc.
. (Roby ὅ 961), to represent νεανιεύεσθαι or μειρακιεῦεσθοι. The
word might denote the spirit and vehemence of youth, as when
