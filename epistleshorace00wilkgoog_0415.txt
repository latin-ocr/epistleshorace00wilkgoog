ζ NOTES. 375

Verg. Ecl. 11. 3² calamorum coniungere plures, and Etl. 111. 25
fistula cara iuncta refer to a very different musical instrument.

tubaeque aemuia: the lengthening of the tibia by means of
the brass vincturae would tend to make itas powerful as a

trumpet.

203. tenmaofsound ‘thin,weak’. pauco, very rareintbe
singular: but Gell. xx. 1, 31 has Iniurim factas m( assibus
sanxerunt. Non omniuo omues iniun'as aare ista pauco diluerunt:
Bell. Afric. van. a pauco tritici numero: Vitruv. 1. 1, 6 paucam
manum. The word is similarly used by Appuleius, and there·
fore seems to have belonged in this usage to the suino plebeius.
parvo, found in some MSS. is clearly an attempt at correction.

foramine: ‘Varro ait...quattuor foraminum fuisse tibias apud
antiquos, et se ipsum ait in templo Marsyae vidisse tibias quattuor
foraminum. Quare quaterna tantum foramina antiquae tibiae
habueruntt alii dicunt, non plus quam tria' Acron. The tiliae
pares in the British Museum (found at Athens) are about 15 inehes
long, and have five holes at the top and one underneath. Those
represented in pictores found at Pompeii (eg. Μανία de Naplen
Vol. 111. 35, aod 154) are about twice that length, but bave not
the holes clearly marked.

2⁰4. ιᾱφπιτοεσυνανλεΐν ‘to give the note to’. adom
‘accompany'. ,.

2⁰6. quo=inquaa numerabilis ‘easily couuted’: Horace
¹ was the first to use the word, which is probably derived from the
similar use of εὐαρίθμητον, asin Plat. Symp. 179 c. πολλῶν πολλὰ
rol καλὰ ἐργασαμένων εὐαριθμὴταις δή τισιν ’ἔδοσαν τοῦτο γέρας ol
θεοί. Cp. Theocr. XVI. 87 dptflyaarolo ἀπὸ πολλῶν. nane not
with numerandis, but ‘of course ². Schutz takes away the comma
after parvus, that utpote may go with the adJectives of y. 207,
holding that the reason why the people cante in small numbers
to the theatra was not only because they were few, but also
because they were virtuous and temperate. But these latter
qualities would make them content with simple music, not keep
them away from the theatre altogether: this abstinence was no
virtue in the eyes of the ancient world. Or. rightly says that
cartus verecundusque have reference to the religious feelings of
the audience. · , ⁴

2⁰⁸. urbes appears in all MSS. with one uriimportant ex· t
ception. Bentley adopted (in silence) the reading of some earlier y
editors urbem, and Sehiitz follows him, arguing that the reference ¹
can only be to Rome, as in¹ the preceding lines· But there is no
reason to doubt that Greece was in the mind of Horace quite as
much as Rome, if not more so, sor there was apparently no great t
change in the music or diction of the chorus at Rome. The ex·
