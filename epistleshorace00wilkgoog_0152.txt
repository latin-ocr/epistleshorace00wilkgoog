112 HORATI EPISTULAE.

ιι) to C. Marias is the equivalent os incultis moribus in Sall. Jug. -
85, 39: hence as Bentley saw, et, not nec, is the right reading.
It has also iar better authority. In good prose an adverb of
quality, as distinguished from one oi degree, is not used with an
adjective, as here, and in A. P. 3turpr'terotrum, Carm. 111. 11, 35

2⁶· melda curarum tomenta. There are two chief diiii·
culties here, the force of frigida, and the case os curarum.

birmento being medical applications, are they intended to relieve ⁴

the curae, or do they consist in the curari Is the genitive one
of the object (Roby ἕ 1312, S. G. ἓ 52 5), or of material (Roby
ς 1304, S. G. ἓ 523)? It seems to me that the curas, the par-
suit of petty ambition and the love of money, are what Horace
wishes Celsus to abandon, as hindering him in attaining the
blessings which philosophy (sapientia) alone can give. In that
case, the J‘omenta must consist in the curae. Frigida will then
have its full natural meaning as ‘chilling ’, the cares are repre·
sented as chilling appliances which kill all generons warmth of
spirit. No difficulty arises from the fact that fomento primarily
meant worm applications, for the word had acquired a more
general meaning, so that the medical writer Cornelius Celsus
can speak ot both warm and cold, both dry and wetfommw
