EPISTLE XVI.

Α The tone adopted in vv. 17 ff. of this Epistle makes it pretty
clear that the Quinctius,¹ to whom itis addressed, was a man
Ξὲἓιιςειεὲιιῗιι Ηιὸιςε. ῒὶΤΙιεΙ-Ῑειιιιιιιῠι Ode1 oitsslre segond book 13
ress o a urnc us irprnus; au 1 as een argue
from the mention of cani capilli in v. 15 of that Ode that this
Quinctius must bave been at least as old as Horwe. But it is
probable that the reference there is only to the poet himself,
und that the lenis iuventus of ν. 6 is more applicable to his
friend. There is therefore nothing to prevent us from supposing
that the Ode and the Epistle are addressed to the same man.
He appears to bure already attuined conspicuous success in his
ambitious career ; and may with some probability be identified
with T. Quinctius Crispinus, the consul of ne. 9.. (The sur-
’ name Hirpinus 'of Carm. 11. ιι presente difficulties as yet
unsolvedr cp. ,Wrckham's Introduction.) Chronology‚ es well
as his character as timus, preventa us from identifying him
with the worthless 'lq' uinctius Crispinus, praetor in M>- rr
but Orelli thinks that he may have been his father. The Epistle
cannot have been written before n-c.' ap, when Octavianus
received the title of Augustus (v. r9); as Horace was in posses·
sion of his Sabine estate by nc. 33, and as Quinctius at th'u

time knew very little about it, this ἔοις to show that the friend*-

ship between Horace and himsel was not of long standing.
Tbere is nothing to fix the date more precisely.

Quincti, the form found on coins of the Augustan time: the
