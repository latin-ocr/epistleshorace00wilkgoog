5⁷. onustorum, not, as Macleane seems to suppose, all
the sora, but like omnis domus in v. 44, ‘the whole forum’.
At the date of this Epistle the forum Augusti was probably not
finished, sor we know from the story in Macrob. Sat. 11. 4 that
Augustus was rnuch dissatisfied with its slow progress.· The
temple of Mars Ultor, which formed part of it, was not dedi·
cated until nc, a, although part of the sorum was opened before
this date (Suet. Aug. XXIX). Hence only the forum Romanum
and the small sorum Julium were in use at this time. There
were several tribunalia in the* forum, but the ‘vir bonus' would
only attract the eyes of those around the one, at which he hap·
pened to be acting at the time as iudex.

58. vel porco vel bove. ‘According to the rules of the
ppntiffs an ox was the properanimal to 'sacrifice to Juppiter,

‘ood man nihil arcano qui roget ore deoru· and the rule of

hagoras (quoted by clem. Alex. Strom. lv. 26, 173) was
μετὰ φωνῆς εὔχεσθαι. This passage of Horace'is imitated by
Pers. 11. 3-16; and· in Ovid Fast. V·,⁶75·-⁶90 a merchant is

the past, and his aid for similar tricks in the future. Conington
(on Persius l. c.) says ‘Horace apparently merely means that
while the worshipper asks the gods sor one thing his bent is set
on another': but this xview is hardly reconcileable with the
language oi the text.

60. lavem, the Roman equivalent to our Saint Nicholas:

not with aint Nicholas’ clerks, I'll give thee this neck ’.· Schol.
