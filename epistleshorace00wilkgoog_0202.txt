162 HORATI EPISTULAE.

6. lebedum, a small town on the sea between Smyrna and

Colophon. octonaria cp. Carm. 11. 6, y lassa maris ct viarum t

Tac. Anu. 11. 14 taedia viarum ac maris ; Cic. ad Fam. xv1. 4, r
nan dubitoquin, quoad plana valeas, tc neque navigationi neque
vtae committas.

v-1o. These lines are marked in the codd. Bland. as a dia-
logue between Bullatius and Horace, thus: Banu. Scis...sit?
How. Gabiis...aicus. BULL. tamen...furentcm. We need not
assign Gabiis...aicus to Horace: but itis very probable that the
whole passage is to be regarded as spoken by Bullatius. There
is a close parallel in Ep. 1. 16, 41-43‚ where the answer of a
supposed ‘interlocutor is similarly brought in without any intro-
ductory word, and Horace demurs with a sentence beginning
withred. We get additional point in line 26, if we suppose the
reference there to be to Lebedus. This view has the support of
Haupt and other good recent editors. ,Sir T. Martin supposes
that Bullatius had expressed himself to this effect in some letter
to Horace: this is hardly necessary. The idea may have been
drawn from his character. Lebedus r'sa desolate place, butI should
bc glad ta live there in retirement, warching the raging sea.

7. dantis: cp. Juv. vr. 56, x. 102, where Gabii aud Fidenae
are coupled as unimportant places. Of Gabii, Dionys. Hal.
Am· R. lv. 53 says νῦν μὲν οὐκέτι συνοικουμένη ardna, πλὴν ὅσα
μέρηδξωδὶκςύὲτω κατὰὶτέᾆν &dg [i.e. &he road to Praeneste]
rre ero vna ρωποςκιι ε rara η μεγα η.

8. fidenis: Verg. Aen. vl. 773 shortens the first syllable,
ἕζξείνῖᾳιιι Famam, Juvenal l.c. like Prop.1v.(v) 1, 361ength-

vellom. Roby§ 1536, S. G. 5644. ’

⁹. cnutus, ‘my friends forgetting‚ by my friends forgot‚'
Con. and Martin; a version imitated from Pope's imitation of
Horace, Eloisa to anelare, 207:

‘How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot,
The world forgetting‚ by the world forgot.’

11. meoque. Some commentators have gravely doubted ,

’ whether there was mud in the Appian Way. Lucilius (Frag.
88 Lachm.) seems to have found some: amne iter est haclabasum
atque lutosum. The road was at this time strewn with gravel
(glarea) instead of silex. Wilmanns, no.935. “

11-1o. Nay, but what may begaad enough sara time, will
not sanisy ane always.

12. caupona. The metaphor of an inn was commonly
employed by the philosophers of the time, e. g. Arrian Epict.
