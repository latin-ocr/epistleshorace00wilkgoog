(note), 111. 31, 125 rerum enim copia verborum copiam gignit,-
Cato’s rule rem tene, verbo sequentur ,· and the saying of Asinius
Pollio, quoted here by Porphyrion orale bercle eveum verbis
nisi rem sequantur. Acron reminds us how Menander used to
say that he had finished a play as soon as he had settled the
plot, even if he had not written a line.

³12. quid debeat, ‘his duties towards' etc. not, of course,
with any special reference to himself, but generally what duties
are owed by men. Hence it is needless with Peerlkamp to
change the second quid into quir.

ort. consaluti, ‘asenator'. Paul. D. p 41 M. concrepet
dicebantur, qui cc equestri udone patribus adscribebantur, ut
numerus senatorum expleretur. Livy, 11. 1, 10 says ddnde
[senatus]..patrum nanterum prirnoribus equestris grooics lectis
ad ccc summam expiarit, traditumque indesertur, utin senatum
vocarentur, qui patres quique conscripti essent: contemptos, vide·
licet novum in senatum, appellabant lectos. Festus, p'. ²54 M.
says that 164 plebeians were thus added to the senate. Ac·
cordiug to this story, which has been generally accepted, the
familiar phrase patres conscripti is for patres et conscripti. Itis
quite clear that Livy and Festus are in error in supposing the
newly added senators to have been plebeians: it is absurd to
suppose that at a time when the plebeians were admitted to no
magistram, they should have constituted a majority of the
governing council (cp. Madvig Verſs u, Veroo. 1. 125, Herzog
Gescb. d. R. Staatso. 1. 130). ' But'it is further probable that,
in spite of the credence given to it by some of the best autho-
rities, eg. Becker, Mommsen, Lange, and Madvig, the story,
and with it the current explanation of the phrase patres conscripti,
is to be rejected altogether. Canscnpti rs a ver'y doubtful equi·
valent for adlecti, and that patres meant the patrician senators ,
alone cannen be regarded as established, in spite of Mommsen’s
arguments in Rbm, Forscb. 1. 218 ff. Hence lhne Ro'm, Gescb.
1. 116 [E. T. 137-8] and Willems, Le Senot 1. 38-65, Droit
Romaiu pp. 187'—9 maintain that patres conscripti means simply
‘the fathers (patricians) who are'on the roll'. Thus we can
understand Cic. Phil. xm. 13, auctoravit calceos, poter con-
scriptus sactus est. Consumptis alone occurs only here. The
strongest argument for the current view is drawn from the
quotation in· Festus, p. 254 ‘quc' potres qui eonscn'pti’ vocati
suntin mn'onc, which Mommsen, Rom. Forscb. 1. 254 (note)
regards as reproducing the formal summotis of the herald in the
forum. '
