rra HORATI EPISTULAE.

nomi-day siesta. dloa: if the birthday oi Angustus is meant, this
is marked in the Calendars as hP, a sign which, as Mommsen
(C. I. Lat. 1. 3⁶7) has shown, denotes the day as a diesfeeiatua
on which no business wasto be done. Hence Torquatus would
not have to appear in the law-courts.

12. quo mint *romanam the MSS. are pretty equally
divided between this reading and fortuna: Munro says (Introd.
p. 32) that ‘ all the best MSS.’ have the latter, and Ritter seems

lan e does not give us much hel in deciding between the
two. he accusative occursinOvid m. 1'11. 4, 41 quo tibi for-
mosam, si nan nisi casta placebat? and in 11. 19, 7 qua nze'lti for·
tunam, qaae nunquam fallere curet? Phaedr. 111. 18, 9 quo mi,
inquit, mutam speciem, si vincor sono. In these cases it might bc
argued, as here, that the difference between fortuna and fortuna
(the way of writing the accusative in many MSS.) is so slight
that MS. evidence is of little valae. But that the accusative is
legitimate is put beyond a doubt by Ov. Am0r. 111. 7, 49 quo
milri fortunae tantum? Met. X111. 103 quo tamen haec Ithaco!
and by Cato Distich. 4, 16 qua ribi dicitius, si semper plauper
abundari Cp. Ar« Lysistr. 193 ποῖ λευκὸν lrrrov3and Mar and’s
note on Stat. Silv. 1. a, 188. On the other hand, that the abla-
tive is also legitimate hasbeen made very probable by Conington
in his desence oi the MS. reading quo nunc certamine mato? in
Aen. lv. 98, although there even Kennedy accepts the conjecture
certamina tanta. On the whole, as the accusative is the more
certainly established construction, and has plenty of authority
here, it is safer to read fortunam. The accusative is governed
by some verb understood, though what particular verb is to be
supplied was probably not distinctly conceived (cp. Roby
ἐξ 1128, 1441: S. G. ἓ 472, 583). For quo, which is certainly
not to be regarded with Orelli as a form of theold dative quor,
cp. Sat. 1. 6, 24 and Roby 11. p. xxx note. fortunam=‘ wealth‘,
a meanirpga in which the plural is much more common in
classical tin.

with which the prospectos wealth passing to an heir was viewed,

14. macte is next door to ⁹, the metaphor beinp probably
derived from the seats in the theatre‚ where those o the same

social position were ranged together. The word seems tobe used
nowhere else in this sense.
