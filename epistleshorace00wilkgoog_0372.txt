ing years, as eg. in Ep. 11. a, 55 f. ‘There is nothin'g of the air ἶ
of a man who is weary and feels that his work is done’ (Nettle i
ship). It is true that in v. 306 he says that he is now writing
nothing himself ; but this expression may be referred just as

well to that period of inactivity which followed the publication

of Odes 1.-111.‚ and to which Horace refers in Ep. 1. 1, as to

that which marked the latest years of his life.

(6) The metrical structure of the Epistola od Priones has
been carefully examined by Haupt and Michaelis, without lead·
ing to any very definite conclusion. But in some points it stands
midway between the First and the Second Book of the E istles.

(7) Prof. Nettleship has remarked that the Rhine dv. 18)
would not be a welcome theme for poets or their patron after
the defeat of Lollius on its banks in Β. e. 16. (Tac. Arm. 1. ιο.)

On the other hand we must not forget the brilharrt campaigns ol
Drusus in ac. 12, rr, and 9.

(8) The arguments for the traditional date drawn 'from v. 63ff.
break down upon a more correct interpretation of that passage,
for which see notes in loc. ·

(9) It is noteworthy that there is no trace of intimacy with
Augustus in this epistle. His name is not even mentioned. Now
Horace was probably in very close relations with the emperor
after his return to Rome from the East in mc. 19.

All indicatious therefore agree in pointing to atime not far
removed from the date of the'First Book of the Epistles, i.e.
about Β. c. ao, as the date for the composition of the Epistola
ad Pisones. But this date is quite incompatible with the identi-
fication of the Pisos given by Porphyrion. It only remains
then that we should regard this as an unlucky guess of the
scholiam, or rather of the unknown authority on whom he drew; r
and see what other Pisos are available. The name was a very ’
common one in Rome at this time, and no little care is required
in reading Cicero or Tacitus to keep its various hearers distinct.

But one of the most eminent was Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the
consul of Β. c 23. He had fought against Caesar in Africa, and
had afterwards joined Brutus and Cassius. After the amnesty
which followed the battle of Philippi, he had kept aloof from
ppblic life, until Augustus urged him to accept the consulship.

have been born not later than n. c. 40. But another fact enables
us to determine the date of his birth more precisely. At his
death in Α. Ι). ao he could appeal to Tiberius per quinque et
quadraginta annonem obsequium, whence it appears that he ’
must have entered upon public life not later than luc. ad.
We must therefore place his birth in tac. 44, so that at the
death of Quinctilius he was in his twentieth year. This Piso

plays au important part in the earlier years of the reign of y
