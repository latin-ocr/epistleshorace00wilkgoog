needless; this absurd ‘mutual admiration‘ based upon vanity is
not really, as he thinks, a matter of pleasure in the long run,
rather than annoyance.

hio, probably Propertius, who delighted to be regarded as the
Roman Callimachus (v. roo: cf. Propert. v. r, 63-64). li
chronology forbids ns to regard him as'the bore of Sat. 1. 9
(cs. Palmer's edition, p. 219), written about tac. 35, he had pro-

‘The charge of belonging to a elique of mutual admirers might
with a show of fairness be brought against one who, amongst
other instances of exaggeration, compared his friend Ponticus to

exclamation not, I think, used by the author of his own work,
as most editors take it, but of mutual compliment, as seems to
be required by the context· Bentley objected (1) that oria
could only be used of external appearance, which is out of the
question here: (a) that caelatum Musis could only mean ‘adorned
with figures of Muses' (asin Ov. Met. x111.110caelataarima·
