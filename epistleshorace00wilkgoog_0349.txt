Blr. ΙΙ. Ep. 112] NOTES. ‘ 309

101. marmot: cp. Ep. 1. 6, 65. Although Callimachus
(flor. mc. a6o-a4o) was ranked by some critics (e. g. Quintilian
x. r, 58 cuiar princeps habetur Callimachus, with Mayor's note)
as the first of elegiae poete, Horace seems to have agreed with
› Ovid, Am, 1. 15, 14 quamvis tagenio non volaterranum. In
any case Mimnermus (flor. ne. 640-600) was the first to use
elegiae verse for love poetry (cp. Prop. 1. 9, 11 plus in amore
valet Mimnermi versus Homero), and it was naturally a higher
compliment to give to an erotie poet the name of the founder of
his style oi poetry, tban that of one who was not especially dis·
tinguished in this department, and who had devoted himself also
to so many branches oi literature, prose as well as verse.

opt1v0=adoptiva adscito Porph. The word is properly a
legal term: Gaius 1. r 54 vocantur autem lte' qui nominatim testa·
rnento tutores dantur, dativi; qui ca optione sumuntur, optivi.
Hence it means ‘any which he may choose'. Maeleane is not
exact in rendering ‘desired', nor is there any reason to suppose·
this only a later use. The tutoris optio was sometimes given to
awoman by the will of her husband or father (liv, xxxlx. 19, 5).
In the time oi Claudius women above th'e age of puberty were
released from the guardianship of their agnates, which had been
ordained by the Twelve Tables, and allowed to choose their

1 own tutor (Gaius 1. 157) and iu the Lex municipii Salpensae
¹ (cire. mn. 81) c. 22 the ius tutoni optandi is spoken oi as no new

thing. The word is much more likely to be an archaism.
muttit ‘is glorified'. ¹

los-106. So long as 1 arn myself composing‚ and am a
candidate ior popularity‚ 1 have to put up with much: but as
soon as 1 return to my senses, 1 can stop my ears when poets
tacite, and sear no revenge on their part. Kel er has a mark of
interrogation at auris, which is not so good.

Orelli argues that the rhythm oi the verse requires us to take
inpune with legonatus, understanding that the poetasters ean
thenceiorward reeite without any sear oi retaliation on the part
oi Horace (as in Juv. 1. 1-3). But the context requires us rather
to regard Horace as now able to do what he dared not do before.
