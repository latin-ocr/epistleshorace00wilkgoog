commonly ascribed to thern (Ep. 11. 1, 244) there is, Ι think, no
trace in tragedy. Argis (Ep. 11. a, 128 note): the Argives are
contrasted with the Thebans, probably because of the prominence
of the legenda, dealing with the struggle between thern, in the
tragic cyclo. {illigamemnon is the typical Argive, the character

to the plot of the play, which is dealt within 125-r 35, than to
the character ot each individual.

editors, including Bentley, prefer to take it. It is almost neces·

honoratum: this use of the word for ‘illustrious’ [cp. Ep. 1.
1, 107 note] is so rare, and seems so otiose in itself here, that
Bentley boldly replaced it by Homereum: and this has been
accepted by some ol the best modern editors. Butit isa
form lound nowhere else, hence L. Miiller prefers Bentley's
alternative Honzcriacum, which is supported by the analogy
of Hellespontiacas, Tartessiacas, etc. The adjective in prose
is Homerr'cus, and this, as Schiitz shows, is only used where
there is a reference to a particular passage in Homeri e. g.
Cic. de Leg. 1. r,n Homericus Ulixes Deli se proceram et
teneram palmam ordisse delcit, ie. ‘Ulysses in Homer (od.
v1. 162) said that he had seen', etc. The epithet howa-
tuna may be best defended, by bringing out its full meaning:
‘when in the receipt of his due honours’: where he complains
that he is ἀτίμητος asin ll. 1. 644, or is lamenting over Patroclus,
the epithets ot v. 121 are less suitable to him. Still in Cic. de
Leg. 1. rr, 32 it is used simply as contrasted with inglorius. For
Cic. Orat, 9, 32 see Sandys ad loc. [I think Horace may have
written inoratam in the sense of inexorabilem: cp. Prop. v. rr,4
non exorato stant adamante vaire. J S. R.]

maddened husband, carrying with her her two sons Learchus and
Melicertes. Athamas seized the former and tore him to pieces:
Ino flung herself into the sea with the· latter, and they were
changed, the mother into the sea-goddess Leucothea, the son into
Palaemon. Cp. Ovid Met. 1v. 416-5412 Hom. Od. v. 333 ff.
The woes oi Ino (Ἰνοῦς ἄχη) became proverbial, and ‘she was
