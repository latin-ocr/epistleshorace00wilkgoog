⁴ 252 HORATI EPISTULAE.

In Ep. 1. a, 16 which Orelli adduces to defend the MS.
reading, extra is just as much a proposition as intra: and
similarly in Liv. xxxn 24 intra cam (portam) extraque. Schiitz
says that intra oleam conveys the just meaning, whereas extra
nucem would mean not ‘on the outside of the nut' but ‘apart

from it’ and that therefore the construction was necessarily ’

changed. I think Bentley‘s emendation a great improvement.
The sense is: is we are to be led astray by comparing things which
though alike in some respects differ in others, like Greek and
Roman literature, then we may as well argue that an olive has
no stone because a nut has none, or a uut no shell because an

olive has not. We may go on to say that there is nothing lacking ’

to our perfect success, even in painting, in music, or in athletics.

82. fortunae: Schiitz (after Lehrs) objects to this word ;
and says that it was a very poor compliment to Augustus for
Horace to regard it as absurd to suppose that the Romans had

reached the height of fortune under hrm. He suggests culturae, l

though in good Latin this word never has the meaning which
proplpslppprepuired here of the result of cultivation, but only the

he is allowed to transpose it to after 107. l do not see any fatal
objection to the traditional interpretation, as above, though cer·
tainly the logic isneither clear nor¹ good. Porphyrion oddly ,

takes it oi poetry‚ ‘sed hoc intellegi quam a se dici maluit!

alike despised by the Romans until the days of the Empire.

³4. vina: Pindar praises old wine and new poems(Ol.1x.

adrogetr we might be content with the meaning ‘claims‘
here andin A. P. 122, while that is clearly the force of the word
in Sat. 11. 4, 353 but in Carm. tv. 14. 40 that rendering is less
satisfactory τ fortuna...0ptatum peractis impetiar decus adrogauit.
