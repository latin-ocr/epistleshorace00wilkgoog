776. rumpis (flor. nc. 536) was undoubtedly the inventor
oi tragedy: all our authorities agree upon this. But Horace has
strangely mirred up the origin of tragedy with that of comedy.

developed into the Old Comedy: and ‘it is clear enough that the
waggon of Thespis mnnot well consist with the sestal choir of the
Dionysia: in fact this old coach, which has beemietched from
Horace only, must be shoved back again into the lumber·roam’
(Gruppe Anodne p. raa). Horace's account is equally incon-
sistent ‘with the poetical requirements of the Athenian public
trained by the enlightened policies oi Solon and Peisistratus’
(Mahaffy Gr. Lit. 1. 234). Thespis composed his dramas ‘sor
city feasts and ior an educated audienceq He acted himself ς
but whether he was the leader oi the chor'us, and only delivered
a kind of epic recitations between the chorio songs, as Mahaffy
holds, or held a dmmatic dialogue with the leader oi the chorus.
as is the more usual opinion, is a point which our authorities do
not enable us to determine with certainty. Bergk (Gr. Lir. 11.
257) distinguishes the ‘choir-master’ from the ‘choir-leader'‚
and thinks that at first the former delivered the speeches‚ and
that afterwards there was sometimes adialogue between the two.

Bentley’s conjecture oi qui ior quae is very attractive, and has
been accepted by Ribbeck, L. Miiller and Schiitz.

nemausensibus ora: this was limited to condy, where
the actors are said, according to a somewhat doubtful story,
to have smeared their iaces with the wine-lens of the new
vintage (τρύξ), and hence to have got their name τρυγῳδοί. This
word is rather contemptuous andis never used oi tragediam, cp.
Bentley on Phalaris 1. p. 342 ff. (ed. Dyce).
