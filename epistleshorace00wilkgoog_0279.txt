uhi quid: the great preponderance of Ms. authority is here ’
in favour of quid, aud Keller admits that it must have been
found in the archetype, though he is inclined to think it au
error for quis, which Yonge‚ Ritter‚ Schiitz, Kriiger, L. Miiller ἶ
and Orelli all retain. It iscertainly more natural to have quis, ἓ
referring to emmor: but perhaps quid may be defended of au
act, rather than a thing.

meent still keeps up the double reference: cp. Ov. Her. ι
y. 103 nulla reparabilis arte lacta pudicitia est. .

8. fn breve te oosst: applied to the book this means ‘that
you are rolled up and replaced in your case’3 in its reference to
the young slave it means ‘that you are brought into sad straits ’.
Cp. Ter. Haut. 669 hac re in angustum oppido nunc meae
cogunturcopiar. ·

9-18. Yam may de liked well enough when you arc young,
but the time will come when you will be neglected, or sent mat aff
the country ,· and a dismal old age awaits you.

9. cucumam ‘if the prophet [ie. Horace] does not
lose his foresight iu his vexatiou with ὼε offender’.

1⁰. dunat, the reading of the archetype, may well be
defended, as expressing the anticipation in the mind of Horace
that it will be so. Cp. A. P. 155sessmt donec cantor...dicat.
Bentley allows deserit to stand in his text without remark, but
this is barQer possible, and has little authority. 'Cp. Ep. ξ. 18,

early instance of the construction so familiar in Tacitus (Driger
Har.. Synt. 11. 585) where ,donec is regularly used with the sub·
juncuve without any suggestion of either expectation or purpose.

‘atas ‘youth ’‚ rarely so used, unless the context clearly
points to this meamng: tn most, rf not all the passages quoted
as parallel, eg. Ter. Andr. 54, 286, ‘tune of hfe' is a better
translation: but Qrc. de off. 115 13, 45 tua auctasjncidit in id
ἕέἴξῑὲ ‘lgttltmttfhttt‘tt ἐξ ἓᾝοῗῗέἑῗὲῗ
