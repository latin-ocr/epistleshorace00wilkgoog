312 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

Ennius praised his medanum os (Annal. vnt. ,παρ and said he
was called ‘flos delibatuspopuli Suadaeque medulla . Cato cen·
sorlus was consul in nc. 195. The plural denotes ‘men like C. ’s

Bentley on Lucan 1· 317.

11⁸. altus, properl ‘neglect’‚ ‘letting alone', hence the
result of neglect, ‘moulil', ‘rust’‚ ‘squalor'. Cp. Verg. Aen.
vn. 440 victa sr'tu...senectus. Georg. 1. 72 et segnem patiere siu
durescere campum. Seneca, in the very interesting Epistle (Vl.
6) in which he points out how inany words used by Ver 'l had
become obsolete in his own time, says (ἓ 5) id ago...ut oc in·
tellegas quantum apud Ennium et Accium verborum situs oc·
cupavoic, cum aprici hunc quoque, qui cotidie excutitur, aliqua

informis ‘unseemly'. Horace himself indulges bnt rarely
in archaisms, whether of vocabulary or inflexion, and these aro
much more common in his earlier writings than in his later ones

de Orat. 111. 38, 153 allows an occasional useoi unfamiliar (inusi-

iungendis verbis, ut haec [expectorare‚ versutiloquae]: sed saepe
acl sine coniunctione verba novantur ut ille senius desertus,
ut di genitales, ut bacarum uberate incurvescere.

wan (op. cit. pp. 59—77) after excluding all words, not
found elsewhere, but apparently technieal‚ or for other rea-
sons not to be assigned to Horace himself, gives a list of ¹30⁴
or about one in eve 60 lines; a proportion less than that occur·
ring in Vergil who as about one in every 40 lines. He justly

concludes that the originality of the style oi Horace is dne ,

mainly to the skill with which he used the existing stores ol the
language: as Quintilian says (x. 1, 96) Horatius varius figuris ct

mus, personified as in Α. Ρ. 71, and spoken of here asa
‘hegetter’ of new words, while there it is the despot who decides
