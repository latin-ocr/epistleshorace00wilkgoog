famous athlete contemporary with the poet. This quite dis*-

ses of the notion that there may be a reference to the F arnesc

ercules, the work of the sculptor Glycon. The reading Mi·
lonis mentioned by Acron, is simply the substitution of a more
familiar name. Cp. Arrian Epict. Diss. 1. a, 37 οὐδὲγὰρ Milium
ἔσομαι, uni ὅμως οὐκ ’ἀμελῶ τοῦ σώματος· οὐδὲ Κροῖσος, καὶ οὐκ
duellii rip κτήσεως· οὐδ’ ἅπλῶς ἄλλον τινος rip ἐπιμελείας, aa
τὴν artmano τῶν ἄκρων, ἀφιστάμεθα.

sl. corpus pronibere chaum. For the construction of
pmhibere=⁸guard’ cp. Cic. de Off. 11. ra, 41 cum prohibent
iniuria tmuures (with Holden's note) t Carm. 1. ay, 4 Bacchum
prohibete rixis: similarly with arcere Ep. 1. 8, ro. nodosa, gout
produces chalkstones in the fingers‚ as with Milton, who in his
later years was ‘pale but not cadaverous, his hands and fingers ›
gouty and with chalk·stones’: cp. Sat. 11. 7, 15 postquam
illi iusta cheragra contudit articulos.

82. quadam...tonua‚ formed like hactenus, eatenus etc,
introduced by Cruqaius from the Bland. Vet. and defended by
Bentley against the earlier reading quodam which has equal
MS. authority, but is only a copyist's correction. quadamtenus
is used repeatedly by Pliny the Elder: the other form would
not be good Latin, tenus never being employed with an adverb
of direction, Roby§ 2164. I see no reason to suppose that

Horace is speaking with any irony here. Δ

83, fervat ‘is fevered'. For the mood cp. Robyss 1553,
S. G.§651. Horace appears to haye been especially struck by
the greecl for money rn hrs own tune, and refers to thrs wit
great frequency: Sat 1. 4, 26,11. 3. 825 Ep. 11. r, rr ,11.a,

148, dre. capiatne always masculine in Horace, never in ergilt
Ovid's practice varies: cp. Neue Formenlehre, 1. 655.

84. verba at vocas, ‘spells ancl strains’, the former ap·
parently magle formulae, (Verg. G. 11. rap miscueruntque herbas
et non innoxia verba) the latter incantations, so that Horace
inverts the order of Euripides (Hipp. 478) siaiu δ’ ἐπῳδαὶ καὶ
λόγοι θελκτήριον φανήσεταί τι τῆσδε φάρμακον νόσου. The term
voces however probably also includes instrumental as well as
vocal music (ep. Sat. 1. 3, 8, Ep. 1. a, η, Α. Ρ. ιιό), to both
forms of which great efficacy was ascribed in allaying paim e. g.
