» 63. eat 66161εέ660 dre, ‘at times’: hemenonem, not peccet,
which has very slight authority, is the right meod. Cp. Ep. 11.
a, 182, Sat. 1· 4, 64, Roby5 1687.

’ 66. pleraque ‘much ³, not ⁸ the greater part'3 the meaning
here found is more common in later Latin than in Cicero, 16
indeed it is found at all in his writings.

67. aredii: Bentley fights hard 606 cedat, but admits that
credat may stand, and it is supported by all MSS. 06 any import-
auce.

66. meeum 10016 ‘supports my view’, Ep. rr. 6, 03. Iove
aequo ‘with the favour os Heaveu', i. e. in his sound senses. Cp.
Sat. 11. 7, ¹4 iniquis Vertumnis, 11. 3, 8 (166 iratis. Iniquus
meaning ‘unfavourable', its opposite aequus comesto mean not
merely ‘impartial' but ‘favourable't Verg. Aen. vt. 129 pauci
quos aequus amavit [appium and so often.

66. delendave: -ve has much more authority here than

· ue, and was rightly restored by Bentley. Schlitz objects that

lenda esse reor does not differ sufficiently in meaning lrom

insector to make a disjunctive particle legitimate3 but the disser-
6006, though not great, is enough to admit 06 the disjunctive.

livi: Bentley argued wannly against this reading, contending

that the tvorks 06 Livius Andronicus were 600 antiquated and

”Tuugh 606 any one to maintain that they were exactis minimum

&tantula .· hence he eagerly accepted the reading 06 some MSS„

’ including most 06 Keller's first class, Laeui. But 160Ἢο

‹ writer 06 &perenm-yur, was not at all fit to be placed in e

’ hands 06 school-boys: besides, he was probably a contemporary

06 Cicero, and ‘attracted a certain interest only by his com·

plicated measures and affected phraseology’ (Mommsen, Hert.

tv. ⁵⁸9² cp. Teuffel, Rom. Lr't. g 138, 5). The poems 06 Livius

not unnaturally took their place in a study 06 the development 06
Roman literature.

76. plagosum: the word does not appear to be used else·
where in this active sense: it is found in Appuleius in the sense
06 ‘much-beaten’. We may compare the use 06 wdone, ap·
