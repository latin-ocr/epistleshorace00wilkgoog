duello, the earlier form of bellum, which is derived from it, as
bis from duci &e (Roby ἓ 76, Corssen Ausspr.1². 124-5lt
Horace uses this form in Ep. 11. 1, 254, 11. n, 98; Carm. 111. 5,
38, 111. 14, 18, w. 15, 8. Here, as elsewhere, he seems in·

Bentley there (as here) attacks the reading, bnt it is well supported
