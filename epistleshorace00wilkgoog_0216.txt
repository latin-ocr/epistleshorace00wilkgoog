6. Lamloe protae et aura ‘Lamia’s love and trouble’: this
cannot mean, as some have taken it, ‘my love for Lamia' r pr'etas
seems never to be used with an objective genitive, and itis
doubtful whether it could denote an affection not based upon any
natural ties, such as exist in the case of parents or kinsmen. Ἴ
L. Aelius Lamia is the man to whom Carm. 111. 17 is addressed,
and who is also mentioned in Carm. 1. 26, 8. He was ofa
noble and wealthy plebeian family (cp. Juv. 1v. 154, vr. 384, Tac. 3
Ann. vr. 27), and attained the consulship in ΑΛ). 3. He held
high office under Tiberius, and was honoured with a public
funeral when he died in ml). 33. The name of Q. Aelius Lamia
occurs on a coin of this date, and this appears to be the brother
here referred to. Lucius must have been the elder brother, as
he bore his father‘s praenomen, but he must himself have been
{theatrale traftlrlnthltrtrrl?rrtlrlffssailtt ἒ
praefectus urbi in ΑΛ). 32 he cannot have attained extreme old t
age, though Tacitus speaks of his vivida senectus. The date of

Carm. 1. 26 is uncertain, but is probably as early as rae. 30. i

the indic. (Ecl 111. 84, Aen. 542), but often with the subjunctive,
once at least adverbially (Aen. vr1.492). Livy frequently uses
it adverbially, twice with the indic. (Π. 40, 75 xxxin. 19, a), ι
never with the subjunctive. Ovidoften has the indicative. So
have Celsus and Nepos, both prose writers, probably contem· ¹,
poraries of Horace. ’ “

'l- mucronata-uolanus: the assonance is doubtless acci-
dentale cp. note on Ep. 1. ra, 25. Maera is to express grief,
doleo is to feel it: cp. Cic. ad Att. xrr. 28, a maerorem minari,
dolorem nec potui, mc, si possem, vellem.

8. msulabfflter, a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. About 80 of these have
been noted in the works of Horace. istuc ‘where you are now',
ie. to the woods and fields. mens anmumue=vois καὶ dunis:
‘mens meliora intellegit, animus adesse cupit’, Ritter, ‘my judg·
