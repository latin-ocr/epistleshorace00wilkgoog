’ werae according to the current story the barp had but
four strings at first, aud this number was increased to seven by
Terpander (flor. tte. 670-640), and to tentor eleven, cp. Det.
Biog. 111. 1148b) by Timotheus (fl. 420-380): cp. Miiller's
Greek rit. 11. 76. But the first part of this statement seems very
doubtful: Bergk Gr. Lu. it. 122, 211, Mahaffy Gr. Lu. 1· 168.

212. sortilegis: divination by sortes, strictly speaking, was
not practised at Delphi, although it was at Dodona (cp. Cic. de
Div. 1. 34, 76), and especially in Italy at Praeneste and Antium:
cp. Mommsen, Hist. 1. 187 n: but the term was commonly ex-
tended to any utterance of au creole, as in Verg. Aen. 1v.346
Lyciae sortes, Ov. Met. 111. 130 Phoebeis sortibus, Cic. de Div. 11.
56, 115, where the word sorr is used of the auswer sent from
Delphi to Croesus.

Latin, either by such compression or by the repetition of the

220. vilem ub meum. Although the derivation of τραγῳδία
from τράγος ‘a he·g0at’, because this was the prize offered for
success init, is now abandoned by the best authorities, who derive
the word rather from the goat-like appearance of the chorus,
who were dressed as satyrs (cp. Bergk Gr. Lu. 111. ra-r3‚
Donaldson Theatre ostiu Greeks⁷ p. 68), it was that generally
adopted by the ancients; and there is no doubt as to the fact
that a goat was regularly offered in sacrifice to Bacchus (cp.
Verg. Georg. 11. 380), and that this goat was assigned as the
prize to the leader of the victorious chorus. ·
