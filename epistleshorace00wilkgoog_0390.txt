350 ARS POETICA.

at. meantes, oue of Horace’s ἅπαξ λε’γόμενα. naen·
mom, i. e. elegy. Horace seems to allude to the traditional
derivatiou of tha-yos from t ἔ λέγειν ‘to say ah me', a derivation
quite impossible for scientific etymology. As the word denoted
primarily a plaintivc tune played on the Phrygiau pipe‚ it is
probably of Phrygian origin (Mahaffy, 1. p. 157). The Phry·
glan αὔλησις became widely familiar in Greece in connexion
with the worship of Dionysus aud the Phrygian Mother of the '
Gods, especially through the compositions of Olympus: and
there is reason to believe that it was especially used in laments
over the dead: cp. Plutarch, deelc. ΧΧ1.ὀαύλὸςόψὲκαὶπρώηυ
ἐτόλμησε φωνὴν ἐφ’ ἱμερτοῖσιν ἀφεῖναι, τὸν δὲ πρῶτον χρόνον
εἵλκετο πρὸς τὰ πένθη, καὶ τὴν περὶ ταῦτα λειτουργίαν οὐ μάλα
ἔντιμον οὐδὲ φαιδρὰν εἶχεν, εἶτ’ ἐμίχθη παντάπασιν. But it was
Callinus of Ephesus (circ. tac. 665) who first wrote verses in
elegiae metre, to be sung to the accompaniment of the pipe.
(Bergk, Gr. litteraturgesct. 11. ¹25 ff.) His poems were not of
a religious character, but adapted for ordinary social intercourse.
The only important fragment which we possess (some twenty
lines) was intended to stirap his countrymeu to greater energy
in their struggle with the Magnetes (Bergk, ib. pp. 178-180).
Archilochus somewhat later used the same metre as a vehicla
for the expression of the most varied ernotions, introducing
itin!{iiiiiifiliiflii& Tiiiilinlii‘iaff·
in his 5Εὐνομία with the internd disorderspdnd exremal’dangdr}
of Lacedaemon. Mimnermus of Colophon (circ. tae. 575) wrote
mainly,butnotexclusively,love-poems,audheuceisoftenregarded
as the inventor of the erotic elegy (cp. Ep.11.2, roo), here denoted
by voti contemta compos ‘the feelings of one who has gained
his prayer'‚ ie. of a successful lover. The ‘sweet and tender'
character traditionally ascribed to the poetry of Mimnermus is
not, iu the opinion of Bergk (ib. 11. 262), justified by ‘the vigor· l
ous aud manly toue' in w ich he expresses even sorrowful emo
tious: buta large proportion of the extant fragments consist of
querimonr‘ae over the approach of old age. His love for the
flute-girl Nanuo, who rejected him, was not voti compos. ln·
deed successful love is rarely a theme for elegiae verse: hence
Michaelis prefers to understand the words here of the epigram.

'il- amos refers mainly to the slighter and less dignified
character of elegiacs as compared with hexameters, as Ovid
(Am. 11. 1, ar) calls them leves: but it may allude also to the
more confined metrical structure. Cp. Tennyson's ‘tiny poem’.

lt.. ammana ‘our tenchers’‚ i. e. professors of litera·
ture, asin Ep. 1.19, 40. The origin oft e doubt may have
arisen from the fact that there was nothing plaintive or mournful
iu the stirring ‘elegies’ of Callinus.
