smooth, easy style oi utterance‚ so that Dionys. Hal. de vi
Deniosth. 19 uses στρογγύλη λέξις as opposed to μακρά and
πλατεῖα oi ‘well-rounded’ periods, and ascribes to Lysias (Jud.
Lys. 6) ἡσυστρέφουσα τὰ νοήματα καὶ στρογγύλως ἐκφέρουσα λέξις.
The style oi Lysias is nearly the exact opposite os what some
people mean when they talk of speaking cre rotundo. Co·
nington's ‘ready wit and rounded phrase ' will do.

326. 111v putes centum: the language is here not intended
to be exact; the duodecimal, not the decimal method of subdi-
vision was always used at Rome. The us was divided into ια
unciae, the uncia again into 4 sicilici, or 24 scriptula or scripula ,⁴
sometimes even the scripulum was divided into a simplic, each
gh oi an‘ as. From scrupulus (a small scrupus) comes
scruple: the explanation of the by-form scriptulum is not clear.
Probably it isa translation of γράμμα, which came to coalesce
with scrupulus. Cp. Robyu p. 447 f· S. G. ἕ 189, Hultsch
Gr. u. Rtu. Metrol.2 p. 145,

dicati Bentley’s conjecture dicus is quite unnecessary. Cp,

Carm.1.c7, iudicat Opuntiae frater Megillac. Acron says
that Albinus was a usurer. This is probably only a guess.

327. quincunce: cp. Roby L c.

328. superas: so most Mss: one or two have superest,
one superet which Bentley accepted: but the indicative lends
⁴ livelinessto the dialogue: Roby§ 1761, S. G. ἕ 751. Supero

- not supersum seems to be the technical word in such a case.

poteras is the reading of most MSS.; a lew have poterat.
Bentley adopts this, taking it as placed in the mouth, not ol the
supposed teacher but ol Horace himself, as a part ol the nar·
rative: poterat dixisse, T ricus. This is fairly good, buta need·
less departure from the MSS. The past impl. is best explained
as an expression of some slight impatience: ‘you might have
told me by this time‘3 not as simply lor the pres. (with Keller,
tho), comparing Sat. 11. 1, 16, *forthere too we have ‘an imper·
fect of neglected duty' as Prot'. Palmer calls it. Nor is it ‘you
used to know' (as Macleanc says), which ignores the force of the
perf. ini. Cp. Roby§ 1535, S. G. ἕ 643.

eu=et osten used by the comic poets iu approval. Cp. Brix
on Plaut. Mil. 394.

329. rudit ‘is added’ sc to the quincunx: it denotes the op·
posite ol the previous action, not merely its reversal. nt ‘is the

aFrprrzstppzt’bagelchnical term: cp. the tabula Veleias in Bruns'
, . .

330. un: all Keller's MSS. read ad, which is indefensible in
itselt, but points to at: on tha other hand the Blaud. vet. and B
