με nonam arescusae,

vero dubitabis ct indignabere abieci For ira ‘tage’ followedby ,
a genitive of that which occasions it cp. Liv. 1. 5 ab iram praedae y

amissae: XXI. o ob iram interfecti domini. ‘Anger’ would not
come in naturally before vv. oro, arr. The conjecture dirae
lor ct ira is worse than needless.

2⁰8. samm monimo must be taken together. Some
editors separate by a comma, taking magicos to be ‘wizards’‚

but this usage is doubtful, and terrores is too general to stand by χ

itself here.

sugas: cp. Cic. de Div. 1. 31, 65 sagire enim sentire acute ἵ

est: ex quo sagae anns, qnia multa scire volunt, ct sagaces
dati canes. From the notion of prophetie power that of witch-
craft was easily developed: cp. Carm. 1. νγ, or.

209. lemures: Porphyrion explains ‘umbras vagantes ¹
hominum antediem mortuorum et ideo metuendos: et putant ’

lemures esse dictos quasi Remulos a Remo, cuius occisi umbras

irater Romulus cum placare vellet, Lemuria instituit, id est, 3
Parentalia quae mense Maio per triduum celebrari solebant'. ζ
The derivation i's of course erroneous: the origin of the word is l

uncertain, but it has been suggested (cp. Vaniieh p 169) that ³

it may be connected with clemens, meaning ‘kindly z cp. manes j

Ep 11. r, 138 (note). The Lemures were usually identified
with the larvae, spirits who in consequence either oi wicked
livessor oi a violent death were doomed to restless roamings
about the world at night ς while the lares were the spirits of the
good departed ones. But sometimes the term lemures was used
to include both laruae and lares (Preller Ram. Mytlt.² p. 499).

The festival of the Tamusia, at which they were honoured for y
three nights (on May 9th, 11th and r 3th), is described by Ovid l
Fast. v. 419-492. The connexion with Remus is simply due i

to ‘popular etymology’.

Therma: the Thessalian witches were said to draw down
the moon and the stars from heaven: cp. Epod. 5, 45—46:
Plat Gorg. 513 Α τὰς τὴν σελήνην radesponens τὰς Oceanitides:
Plin. N. H. xxx. r, o Maeander Thessalam cognominavit fabu-
lam, complexam ambages feminarum detrahentium lunam ,· Ari·
stoph. Nub. 749 γυναῖκα φαρμακίδ’ ei πριάμενος θετταλὴν caii
λοιμι νύκτωρ τὴν σελήνην.

alo. msa numeras: ‘quod non iaciunt nimium timidi
ad senectutem et mortem, quia ex natalibus multis obitum iam
propinquum perhorrescunt' Porph. Cp. Mart. x. 23, r-4 iam
numerat placido felin Antonius acuo quindeciens actas Primus
Olympiadas, praeteritosque dies et totos respicit annos, nec munit

Lethes iam propioris apicas. Cp. Pers. 11. 1, o.
