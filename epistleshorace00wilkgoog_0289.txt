Augustus is theone exception to the rule Virtutem incolumem

, odimus. But Mommsen rightly takes this also as a proof that
’ this Epistle cannot have been written before the return of
Augustus to Rome in ue. 13. It would be otherwise incon·
ceivable that the poet who wrote abes iam nimium diu (Carm.
lv. 5, a) should throughout make no reference whatever to his

grffiuce, it he was now spending his second or third year in

te. iurandus aras: iurare, like ἐπομνύναι (Ar. Nub. 1237
ἐπώμνυς τοὺς θεούς), ,ἀπομνύναι (ib. 1232 nal τοῦτ’ ἐθελήσεις
ἀπομόσαι μοι τοὺς θεούς ;)-cp. Zerls ὀμνύμενος ib. iuml—takes

passive.
numen has in its favour not only the vet. Bland. but also
the excellent MS. R, although the majority of MSS. have
menen: the former was restored to the text by Bentley, and has
since received the support of many good editors. Kriiger and
· Schiitz still prefer nomem but the regular phrase was either
iurare per numen or iurare in nomen. Suet. Calig. 24 has
per numen Drusillae dezeram't: and in Tac. Anu. 1. 73 all good
recent editors have adopted the correction of Freinsheim violatum
periurio numen Augusti, though tlre MS. has nemen. Cp. Ov.
Her. rx. 371, xrrr. 159, Pont. r. ιο, 42. Servius too who
quotes these lines on Verg. Ecl. 1. 7 and Georg. 1. 24 has
(according ιο the best MSS.) numen, and adds ‘sic Lucanus de
Nerone [Phars. 1. 63] sed milri iam numen '. Mommsen holds
that this phrase cannot refer either to the altar to Fortuna redux
dedicated when Augustus returned to Rome in tac. 19, or to
that of Pax Augusta οι July Β. e. 13, because neither of these
deities could have found a place in oaths. It must refer, he
holds, to the invocation of the genius Augusti between luppiter
optimus maximus and the Di Penates, which was part of the
remodellingof the worship of the Lares Compitales. This appears
to have been due to a decree of the senate, passed during the
Emperor's absence, although not fully carried out until a later
date Cp. Carm. 1v. 5, 34 Larz'lrus turem miscet numen. Cp.
Corp. I. Lat. 11. 172 si sciens fallofefellerova tuen me liberosque

mcor Iupiter optimus maximus ac divus Augustus ceterique omnes
di imneertoles expertem patria incolumitate fhrtunisque antuibus
saciant (found at Aritium vetus in Lusitania).

temperary merit, and are llindly partial to what is ancient.
