288 HORA TI EPISTULAE. · ἶ

even in the senatorial provinces he had an imperium maius, which
made their governors formally subordinate to him. Hence the
‘iustus triumphus? could no longer be enjoyed by successful
generals, who were only serving under his auspices, not under their
own. During the earlier part of his rule, he sometimes allowed
a triumph, but afterwards (apparently after me. 15: cp. F urneaux
on Tac. Ann. 1. 72) this honour was reserved to members of the
imperial house. Cp. Suet. Aug. xxxvm. nec parcior in bellica
virtute honoranda, snper triginta ducibus iustos triumphos etali-
quanto pluribus triumphalia curamenta decomnda coeravit,⁴ and
c. xxh domuit partim ductu rtim auspiciis suis Cantabriam,
Aquitaniam, Pannoniam, D matiam cum Illyn'co omni; item
Raetiam ct Vindelicos ac Salassos.
