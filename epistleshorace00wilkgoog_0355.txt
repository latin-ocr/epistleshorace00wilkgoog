standing the termination as an acc. plur. No other form but
Argis is found for the dat. and abl.; the genitive does not occurs
the accusative Argos is usually masc. plur. (perhaps always in the

teo. mor, ‘sitting regularly’. Cp. Juv. XIV. 86 (Mayor).

188. ignoscere sem: a reluctance to do this is treated as
a sign ofinsanity in Sat. 1. 3, 80 ff.

1³4. signo lagoenae: wine iiasks were always sealed u ε
cp. Mart. rx. 87, 7 nnnc sr'gnm meus anulus lagoenam. .
Cicero tells Tiro (Cic. Ep. Fam. xvl. 26, al. that his mother
used to seal up even the empty ones ne dicerentur inanes faisse,
qnae furtim essent exsiccatae. Lagoena and lagona are both
legitimare forms, but not lagena: the first has the best support
here, the second in Juvenal. Cp. Fleckeisen Fe'c'nsazg A naen ao.

iao. opibus, Orelli says would have been ape in prose. It
is doubtful whether even in verse the two can be thus inter·

ol Η.’; in Ep. 1. lo, 36 perhaps ‘resources’ is a better rendering
than ‘aid’. Cp. Cic. ad Att. lx. 16 Cacsar sam operamus, non
ut superioribus litteris, opem expectat.

A. Grant on Ar. Eth. Nic. vn. 7, 8 rightly says ‘With the
