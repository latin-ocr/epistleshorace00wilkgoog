plains communicas ‘intacta, non ante dicta', adding that when
a theme has been once treated by any oue, it is proprium, no
longer open to all. In this view communia is identical with
iruxpcrtum os v. ¹²5 and ignota indictaque of v. 130. Orelli,
with many recent editors, extends the meaning os communia, so
as to cover all general and abstract notioris, such as anger, cru-
elty, cowardice and the like3 and takes proprie dicere: ‘to give
a concrete character ἴθ’, i.e. to embody in consistent and vivid
pictures of individuals. This interpretation altogether ignores
the correspondence between communia and publica nzatcrzi‘s on
the one hand, and proprie and privati iuris on the other; but
the parallelism is too close to be accidental. A meaning which
lies on the suriace may aiter all be the right one. Horace has
just been saying: ‘li you choose a subject not previously treated
dramatically‚ you must take care to be consistent in the por·
traiture of your characters’. Now he seems to add: ‘But this
is comparatively easy: the difficulty arises when you endeavour
to trent familiar themes in a distinctive and individual manner.
You are selecting a theme from the Iliad: then you are wise to
confine yourscli to simply throwing Homer's poem into dramatic
shape, instead of attempting an originality of handling‚ which
would probably leod you into inconsistencics'. lt this view of
