rate than Horace, lor ‘even during the Second Punic War

dramatic'performances went on uninterruptedly,irrasmuch aa most 1
ot' Naevius' works and one half of Plautus hterary exertrons ³
(though perhaps the less fertile hals) fall into the time of this ξ

war’ (Teuffel, Rom. Ltt. 1. p. 104). But perhaps it is better (with

Schiitzj to connect quietus closely with post Punica bella, ‘en ,

joying peace aster the close oi the Punic wars’0

16³. Thespis, the traditional founder of the Attic tragedy: ¹

cp, A. Ρ. 276. Horace here neglects the chronological order, as

in sat. 1. 4, 1 Eupolis atquc Cratinus Aristophanesque poetae, ,
Eurpotes could not have been brought into an hexameter verse, ¹

at any rate in the nominative case.

104. amount rem ‘made the attempt’: rem is not, as
some editors suppose, the object os vertere, attracted out os its
place; the construction is like that in Liv. 1. 57, a tetraptota res

est, si capi A rdea posset, 11. 35, 4 temptata res est, si deucere rem ἵ

assent. ·
p vertero ‘translate', without an object expressed.

tot. onena albi Prof. Sellar admirably brings out in his j
Roman Pocts of tte Republic, chap. v.‚ the reasons for the satis· ζ
faction found by the Romans in the drama: cp. especially p. j
151 ς ‘The popularity and power of Roman tragedy, during the ’

century preceding the downfull os the Republic, are to be

attributed chiefly to its didactic and oratorical force, to the .
Roman bearing of the persons represented, to the ethicul and j

occasionally the political cast ol the sentiments expressed by
them, and to the plain and ·vigorous style in which they are
enunciated '. We have fragments more or less important from
'jjtf‘agedies of this period, covering 285 peges in Ribbeck’s
e ron.

166. spirat mcum sana ‘has sufficient tragic inspira·
tion': cp.Carm.1v. 3, 24 quod spiro et placeo si placeo, tuum
est: for the construction cp. Roby§ 1096·7, s.1{G.§461. Stat.
Silv, v. 3, ra altum spirans.

. tellclter audet refers apparently to the bolduess of the
language, especially in Pacuvius aud Accius. Cp. A. Ρ. 56 ff.

16⁵1. molta: the vet. Bland. with some inferior MSS. has
in scrr'ptis, but with inscitiae as a correction. Bentley reads
inscitus, on the strength oi Horace-’s preference lor an adjective
rather than an adverb in such cases, pointing out at the same
time that this accounts better for inscriptis: but these arguments
do not warrant us in departing srom t e MSS. taetitia, ‘want
ot skill’‚ is not so strong a term as inscientia, ‘ignorance’t cp.
Cic. de Orat. 1. aa, 99 (note). .
