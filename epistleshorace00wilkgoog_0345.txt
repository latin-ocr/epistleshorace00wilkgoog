aa 11. Ep. u} Nonas ’ 305

In this reading the thriee repeated alter is far from elegant,
and the combination uterque alterius very dubious Latin, Keller
removes the latter difficulty, but increases the former by substi-
tuting et alter for uterque. But, as Bentley saw,tbereis no ‘nt
in making the two men brothers (as there is in a. 183), anrimfhe
corruption is likely to be in the word frater. Schiitz suggests
fautor, which goes far to remove the difficulty, It is a favourite
word with Horace in very similar expressions: cp. Sat· 1. 10, a
tam Lua'li fautor: Ep. 11. 1, ²3 :asamar vacrum: Ep..1. 15, 33
nequitiae fautoribus: Ep. Ι. 18, 6 fautor laudabit: and the
meaning of ,the substantive allows it to take or to dispensa with
an adverb, as much as an adjective could. That there was
mutual patronage may well be left to b'e understood from the
context. [Prof. Palmer suggests auctor erat consulm a reading
whicparestorer a good classical phrase 'r ‘a rhetorician proposed
toa wyer’. ·

Brut. 33. 126 as a greater orator than his elder brother Tiberius:
eloquentia quidem ruscia an habuisset parem nerninem. Bentley
suggested as a correction Crassus, i.e L. Licinius Crassus, the
- famous orator, who takes a leading part in 'Cicero's three books
De'Oratore. Cicero (Brut. 39, 145) describes how a case was

enee the line of Horace would gain in point by ὼε substitution ol
Crassus for Gracchus: but this is not a sufficient reason to induce
us to abandon tlre MSS. If Horace had any particular Mucius
in view, it was probably the colleague of Crassus: but several
other members of the family were distinguished for their legal
learning, especially P. Mucius Scaevola Pont. Max. (the father
of the colleague of Crassus, consul himself in uc. 133) and Q:
Mucius Scaevola Augur (the lorber-inlati* of Crassus, consul
rac. 117). Hence perhaps we should translate ‘so that the one
was a Graochus, the other a Mucius'.

universally received huic ille. It is plainly impossible t0 believe
that Horace should have written ut liic illi *Gracchus Jlrret, hic
illi Mucius. Keller adduces examples of hic-hrt, but none where
ille is also used in the passage. This line must therefore be re·
