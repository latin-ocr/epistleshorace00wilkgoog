Tiberius, and was accused of hastening the death of Germanicus.
(Cp.Tac.Ann.11. 43, 35, 57, 69-81, 111. 1-18.) His younger
brother Lucius was consul in Β. c. r, and must therefore have
been born not later fflan Β. c. 34, while it is probable thiu he
may have been born some years earlier. If these are the Pisos

l addressed in this epistle, we have in the case of the father, as in
l that of Messalla Corvinus (Canu. 111. ar, 7), Sestius Quirinus

(Carni. 1. 4, 14), Pompeius Varus (earm. 11· 7), and Torquatus

l (Carm. tv. 7), an instance of the loyalty with which Horace

clung to the friends who had gone through with him the cam·
paign of Philippi· ⁴

The title ‘Ars Poetica’, or ‘De Arte Poetica Liber’, is found
in almost all MSS. Quintilian vm. 3, 60 writes id tale est mon-
strum, quale Horatius in prima parte libri de arte poeticafingit:
and in the Epist. ad Tryph. a (prefixed to his Institutio) says
usus Horatii corintio, qui in arte poetica suadet, ne praecipitetur
editio, nonumque prematur in annum. Later grammarians regu·
larlyuse the same title, and it is employed also by Porphyrion
and the socalled Acron. There is no evidence that it comes
from Horace himself 3 it was probably invented by an early
editor, and it is not very suitable to the contents of the epistle,

be intentionally avoided. But a name which hasbeen so long
in use cannot be abandoned without inconvenience3 and it may
be accepted on the authority of tradition, provided we do not
allow it to mislead us as to the real character of the epistle.

Porphyrion adds to the words previously quoted in quern
librum congessit praecepta Neoptolemi τοῦ Παριανοΰ non quidem
omnia, seo' eminentissima. Much difficulty has been found in
accepting this statement. Ritter altogether rejects it: ‘Nam
Horatium sua hausisse ex poeta recente et parum cognito, qualis
fuit Neoptolemus grammaticus et Alexandrinorum studiis imbutus
(cp. Meinekii Analecta Alexandr. p. 375), credat Judaeus Apella '.
But it is not likely to have been a mere invention, and the case

name. Michaelis in his early dissertation de Auctoribus quos
Horatius in libro de Arte Portica secutus esse videtur (Kiel 1857),
argued that Horace could have borrowed very little from Neo·
ptolemus, first because Horace is above all other poets of his
time free from the influences of the Alexandrian school, with its
pedantic eruditiori and tortuons diction, and secondly bemnse he
seems to have had in view in respect of metre mainly the practice
of his countrymen‚ and because his references to the ,early history
of the Greek drama are too confused and inaccurate to have been
derived from an Alexandrian scholar. The first of these ob·
jectionsis sufficiently met by Prof. Nettleship’s reply that there
