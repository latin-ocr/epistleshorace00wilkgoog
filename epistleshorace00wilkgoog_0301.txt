w. monum used where we might have expected ali·
quid, because mutenor=serre non possum, and is thus virtually
negative. · Cp. Madvig Gr. 5 494 b, and note on Cic. Cat. 1. 2‚6

munerun Keller asserts that the contracted form reprendi,
preferred here and in vv. 81, ara by some editors, does not
occur before the middle of the tenth century Α.1)., and that the
archetype certainly had reprehendi. Mr Munro thinks that
Horace ‘perha s always wrote reprendere for reprehendere of
MSS. as twice be certainly did'. But it is to be noticed that in
pptb these lcasus (Sat. 11. ro, 55, Ep. 1. 18, 59) riprend· has the

ort rowe.

eruce ‘coarsely’: crassa Minerw in Sat. 11. n, 3 ‘home-
spun mother wit’. The opposite is tenui filo in v. 225. Cic.
ad Fam.1x.1c‚ α calls his speech for Deiotarus retentaculum
[eviderese crasso filo.

tr. putetur: Roby§ 1744, S. G. 5 74ο, α. The subjunctive
does not depend here upon the non quod, as contras'ted with the
sed quia, but it is equally to be understood after the latter, as
expressing tlre alleged reason for the censure.

79. crocum: flowers were strewn upon the stage, and
saffron juice sprinkled upon it, for the sake of the fragrance:
cp. Lucr. 11. 416 et curn scaena ¹croco Cilici perfusa recens est:
Ov. Art. Am. 1. 104 nec suerunt liquido pulpita rubra croco:
Plin. N. H. xx1.6‚ 33 vino mire congruit [crocum], praecipue
dulci, tritum ad theatra replenda: Sall. Hist. 11. 29 croco sparsa
humus. The masculine form is generally used for the plant.
the neuter for the expressed juice ; hence the word here is pro-
bably neuter: but the distinction is not always observed.

Attae. T. Quinctius Atta was a writer of comoedrhe togatae,
who died according to Jerome on Euseb. Chron. in tac. 78. His
fragments (cp. Ribbeck Com. Lat. pp. rho—164) abound in
archaisms, but are vigorous in style. Cp. Teuffel Rom. Lit.
ς 120. The cognomen is explained by Fest. s. v. p. ια (Miiller)
as proper to those quipropter vitium crurum niet pedum plantt's
imistunt et attingant rengis terram quam ambulant, not differing
therefore muchirom Plautus. Some have not unnaturally supposed
that there is a reference to this in perambulat; but undoubtedl
the primary meaning of this is explained aright by Acron: yn
scoram recepta est, ubi fleres sparguntur. Porphyrion has a
curious notion that it refers to the undue length at which in a
play called Matertera he went through the names of the various

kinds of flowers.
