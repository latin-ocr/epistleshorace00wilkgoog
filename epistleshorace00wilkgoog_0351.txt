cism upon his writings before entrusting them to the general
judgment. But it is doubtful whether peratralia Vestae could
thus be used of a private house, even though there was usually an
altar to Vesta on the hearth. Besides this separates the words too
mech in thought from invita recedant; it is better to render
‘although they may be reluctant to retire, and may still cling to
the sanctuary of Vesta‘s lane'. In the temple of Vesta there
were certain mysterious objects‚ accessible only to the Vestals
and the Pontiffs and carefully kept from the eyes ol the multi·
tude: they were kept in the penus interior or penetrale of the
temple, shut up in earthen vessels, and were regarded as the
pignora imperii (le. xxvr. 27, Ovid‚ Fast. vr. 359, 439). The ,
most famous among these was the Palladium: but there were
also other divine figures (especially of the Penates) and mystic
emblems. (Preller‚ Ro'm. Mytla p. 543). Keller interprete
‘although they may be phrases hallowed by antiquity‚ which it
seems profanation to touch ’. Macleane‘sparaphrase ‘the verses
though they may be expunged, still are kept in the author's desk,
because he has a regard for them and cannot make up his mind
to destroy them’ is quite impossible. Orelli thinks the point to
be ‘although you may plead that, as they are not yet published

’ you need notbeso severe with them'. The only difficulty in the

way of the interpretation proposed above (which does not differ
much from Ritter's) is that there is no positive evidence that the
temple ol Vesta had the privileges of an asylum. But the notion
ol a sacred protection was always associated with the Vestal
Virgins: it they met a condemned criminal in the street he was
set free3 and their intercession carried the greatest weight.
(Prelleu p. 540). Hence it is not too much to assume that those
in danger might have recourse to the temple lor at least tempo-⁴
rary protection. , So Conington,
