354* 'Ares ponerer.

tuni e'uim supra prosam aratiam, quam pedestrem Grecci uocant,

surgit[Plato]. Photius quotes from Aristoph. [Fr. 712, ubemur

uehudoie' ἀλλὰ resti μοι φρώιονε and Plato Soph. 237A has

πεζῆ re ὦδε ἑκάστοτε λέγων καὶ μετὰ μέτρων. This us'e of the
word is very common in later Greek.

96. 'telephus was the son oi Hercules by Auge, daughter oi
the king of Tegea. At his birth he was exposed on Mount
Parthenius, and his mother ssed sor refuge to Teuthras, king of

Mysia, who being childless adopted her as his daughter. When ’ l

:Telephus was grown up, he went forth in search of his mother,
and arrived at Mysia, at a time when Idas was endeavouring to
expel Teuthras virom his throne. Telephus having defeated ldas
'was offered by Teuthras the hand os Auge, and the succession
to the throne: but their relationship was discovered before the
marriage took place. When the Greeks were on their way to
Troy, Telephus was king of Mysia, and being married to a
daughter (or sister) of Priam he drove them back, but stumbling
over a vine, he was w0unded by Achilles. The wound could

not be eured until in pititul guise he went to Agamemnon, and ·

monz'tu Clytaemnestra Orestem infantem de cunabulis rapuit,
minitans ,re eum occasurum, niu sibi Achiui mederentur (Hygin.
Fab. cu). Achilles was prevailed upon to cure him with the
rust of the, spear which had inflicted the wound. Plays were
written upon this story by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides,
Agathou, Ennius aud Accius. Sophocles in his ‘Telephus or
the Mysians’ (cp. Frag. 358—368, 510 D.) dealt with the former
partos the legend: but Euripides, in a play of which we have
some 30 {regments preserved, mainly through the scholiast’s
notes on· the merciless parodies by Aristophanes (cp. Fragm.
6974727 Dine), treated the latter part, representing Telephus
in the greatest misery. For the plays ol Ennius and Accius
ι based upon this cp. Ribbeck Rom. T rag. pp. 104 s, 3441'.

Peleus was banished from Aegina by his father Aeacus sor

, the murder ol his hall-brother Phocus, and fled to Phthia, where

he was received and purified by Eurytion, who gave him his
daughter Antigone in marriage, and a third of his kingdom. In
the hunt of the Calydonian boar Peleus killed Eurytion by
accident, and fled to IolcuS, where he was again purified ‘by
Acastus. Here Astydameia [or Hippolyte Carnu 111. 7, 18].
wile of Acastus fell in love with him, and when her love was
rejected, accused him to Acastus, as Hippolytus and Bellerophon
were accused under like circumstances Acastus in revenge leit ¹
him asleep on Mt Pelion, after taking awa his sword, that he l
might be a prey to the beasts. Peleus on awakeni‘ng was attached
by Centanrs‚ but saved by Chiron. Then followed his famous
marriage with Thetis. Asterwards Peleus gathering an army be-

sieged Acastus in iolcus, and slew Astydameia. F or· the numerous.
