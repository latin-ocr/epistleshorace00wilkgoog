rw. spe hucne: Aristotle describes old men as δυυέλ-1
redae, ie. slow to form hopes, and this seems to be the meaning
required here. But can spe longus bear that meaning? There
is no other instance oi the phrase e but spes longo is used several
times by Horace to denote ‘a far-reaching hope’, a hope which
requires much time forits fultilment‚ ep. Carm. 1. 4, 15 velue
summa brevis spem nos vetat inculcare longam: ib. 1. 11, 6 spatio
brevi spem longam reseces. But the hopes of old men are
necessarily short in their anticipations, and so spe longus seems
to give just the wrong meaning. Hence Bentley read spe
lemur, which he took to mean ‘slow to conceive hopes’. But it

ever lawsully 'bear the meaning ‘holding long to his hopes‘,
that is to say, not expecting the speedy sulfilment of them, as a
young man does, and therefore not pushing on strenuonsly (imru)
to realise them. Much as Horace borroivs here from Aristode,
it is not necessary to suppose that he follows himin every point:
Cic. Fam. 11. 16, 6 has recordor desperationes eorum, qui senes

i erant adulescente me: eos ego fiertasse nunc imitor et utor aetatis
’ vr'tio: but this only shows the possibility, not the necessity of a

similar idea in Horace. Orelli and L. S. retain the explanation
ot F orcellini ‘tardus et difficilis ad sperandum ’, without meeting
ὼε grave difficulties raised by Bentley.

to make Horace reproduce Ar.'s eol δειλοὶ καὶ πάντα προφο-
