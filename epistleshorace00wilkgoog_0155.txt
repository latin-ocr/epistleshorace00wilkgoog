1. 33 is also addressed to him. The date of the Epistle cannot
be precisely determined: there is no reason to suppose that it
immediately followed the publication ol the Satires, none of
which are probably later than Μ. 30, and the tone is not that
which would be adopted in addressing a very young man. It
may therefore be safely placed within the limits assigned to the
Eyistles generally, Μ. 24-20. At the same time the absence
o all reference to the odes points to a date not long, if at all, after
their publication. Ritter ingeniously endeavours to fix the date
to the beginning of Μ. 203 he argues that Augustus read the
Satires of Horace for the first time after his return from Asia
in September Μ. 19, when he made his well-known complaint
that the poet had made no mention of his intercourse with the
emperor, that Ep. xtu. was a reply to this complaint‚ and that
it was written in Μ. 18. But Tibullus could not have been a
critic os his satires before they were published. There arctoo
many weak links in this chain for us to trust to it. Another
independent ar ment, that in the winter of Μ. 21—20 he
went down to 'elia or Salernum to get sat (Ep. 1. 15, 24), and
that here he is represented as having achieved his purpose
ll. 15) does not carry complete conviction.

a wisc man’s life? l'ou have all tlte blessings that hcart could
wish. Livc as if each day were to be your last,· and conte and

1. monum: ‘Satires'2 thereis no reason to include any
epistl'es here, although they seem to be included in Ep. 11. 1, 250'.
moldo: ‘fair'‚ not necessarily favourable, but unprejudiced;
opposed to niger, as we lind the word used in Sat. 1. 4, 85.
