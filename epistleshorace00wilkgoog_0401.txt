184. desilies 111 utum ‘plunge into a place where you will
be cramped'. A writer who begins by copying too closely a
Greek original either in treatment, or indiction, will soon find
that he is as it were working in letters. Mr Yonge reminds us

of Aesop’s rabie of the goat in the well: but orbis suggests ’

rather the noticn ol a horse running a race. Cp. Cic. Acad. 11.

1111. pudor. The copyist will either be ashamed 10 aban-
don a method which he has once adopted; or is not, he will
find that it is impossible 10 deviate lrom the line which he has
taken up, without falling into incongruity.

jad. nee—maroles. Horace appears 10 pass here, by one
oi his rapid transitions so common in this epistle, from the
drama to the epos, to which indeed the cautious 01 the last five
lines are almost as applicabis as 10 the drama ltselt'.

cyclicus: Bentley adopted the form cyanus srom some inse·
rior MSS.‚ but κύκλιος is never used in Greek in the sense for
which κνκλικός is the regular term, except once, ahd then pro·
bably sor euphony. The ‘Cyclic poets’ were those epic poets‚
who probably aster the Iliad and the Odyssey had assumed their
present form, wrote upon various legends, more or less closely
connected with the Tbeban and Trojan wars. They did not, as
'has been erroneously supposed, intentionally write a cycle of
poems3 but the grammarians put together by their aid a cycle
of legends. Their position and works have been exhaustively
discussed by Welcker in his Epischcr Cyclas: there is a full
account ol them in Mure’s literature of Antient Graece, Vol. 11.,
and a brieser one in Mahady’s Greek Literature, Vol. 1. pp. 85
·-89. The most noteworthy were Stasinus, Arctiuus, Lesches,
Agias and Eugammu's. The poet, to whom Horace here refers,
has not been identified. Perhaps indeed he had no particular
writer in view, but is censuring the lack of simplicity in the
school as a whole. In that case olim=aliquonda The line, it
isto be noted, contains nothing in itsels too high-down. as some
have thought. Hence Peerlkamp thinks that the blame of Ho-
race is directed to the extravagant lan age which he supposes
to have followed it, and which would ave been recalled to the
Pisos by his citation oi the opening line. In that case, it would
be very odd that Horace should have omitted just that which he
thinks open 10 censure. But the line, though not extravagant
in itsels‚ contrasts unlavourablywith the modest and unassuming
tone of Homer’s introduction. It has been noticed that the
first book of the Iliad is entirely without similes.
