these fresh wars had reached Rome, when it was still expected
that the temple of janus would be closed. But the temple of
janus was cosed three times during the reign of Augustus
(Suet. Aug. xxm, Mon. Ancyr. 11. 45). The first time was in
lac. 29, after his return from Egypt3 the second in lac. 25, at
the close of the first Cantabrian war. The date of the third
closing cannot bc determined. Orosius (vi. aa? assigns it to
the year of Christ’s birth, a tradition apparenty accepted by
Milton (Hymn on tlrc Nativity, stanza iv.): this rests on very
slight authority, but Mommsen (on Mon. Ancyr. p. 32) is not
‹lisinclined to accept it as approximately true. In any case the
reference in v. 255'is too general to admit of being pressed.

More valid arguments have been adduced by Vahlen (Monaes-
bcriclrtc der Berlincr Alcudcmic 1878, pp. 688 ff.). In v. 111
Horace refers to his resum tion of a form of poetical com·

sition which he had formally renounced. This can only mean
yric poetry. Now the Carmen Saeculare was written in ne.
17, and most if not all ol the Odes in the Fourth Book between
lae. 17 and rac. 13· There appear to be references to some of
these in vv.- 252 ff. (eg. to v. 25 ff, xw. 11, ²9· 33, xv. 6, 9),
orat least to the themes of which they treet. Hence the Epistle
can hardly have been written before uc. 13. In this year
Augustus returned to Rome after an absence of three years in
Gaul, and remained in Rome until lac. ro.

Suetonius (vit. Horat.) tells us that Augustus post sermones
quosdam lectos complained that there was uo mention made of
himself, and said to the poet irasci mc tibi scria, quod rm in
pleresque eiusmodi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris. An
essm
est: Cum lctsustineas, etc. Ritter thinks that Suetonius was
mistaken in supposing that this Epistle was the one written by
Horace in answer to, the remonstrances of Augustus3 and argues
that it must have been Ep. 1. 13. His reasons for this view are
(ι) that this was written too long alter the publication of the
Satires, and (a) that Augustus in acknowledging the receipt of
Horace’s libellus complains of it as being as sh'ort as the poet
was himself: pertulit ad me Dionysius libellum tuum, qum
cgv, ut excusantem, quantuluscunque est, boni cousule- Vereri

objections that Sermones is by no means necessarily limited to
