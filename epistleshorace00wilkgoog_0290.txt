250 HORATI'EPJSTULAE.-

meur, ille tuus 'etc.·, decides to read hoc on very slight authority, ² l
joining in hoc uno: but then, as Ribbeck has shown, the next ’

line becomes quite superfluous, for unum is sufficiently explained ³

bey 15-17. It is possible however that unois masc.. taken with

al. suls temporinos ‘the measure of life assigned to theru’.
The epithet which would more properly belong to the authors
is transferred to their works.

2³. veterum, neuter, not masculine, as is shown by celera,
mota aud defuncta.. Cp. Tac. Anu. 11. 88 vetera extollimus
recentium incuriosi. abutar, the laws of the Twelve Tables,
carried by the decemvirs.

ab. anomia ‘made on equal terms’, a probably unexampled
force of the word, which leads Mr Reid to conjecture that we

should read oe uo icta,· but the transference of meaning is hardly J
too bold for orace: to Gabiis we must supply cum from the

following clause Dionysius Halic. (tv. 58) says that he saw in
the temple of Ζεὺς πίστιος on the Quirinal a treaty made by Tar·
quinius Superbus with Gabii, written on the hide of the ox slain
at the ratification of the treaty· Cp. Niebuhr Hirr. 1. 5¹²· For
treaties with the Sabisres cp. ib. pp. a 31, 561.

26. mbilicum libros, properly the books containing the
laws ol ritual and worship (Cic. de Orat. 1. ry, 193, Macrob. u
Sat. 1. ra, 21),but probably including also t e annales pon·
tryfcum or annales nroximr'. Cp. Cic. de Orat. 11. 12, 52

(note), where Cicero speaks of the entire absence of ornament

in their style. Cp. Teuffel, Rom. Lit. ἐξ 63, 66.

volumina vatum: ‘veteres libros Marcii vatis aut Sibyllae’:
the oracles of the Sibyl were written in Greek; but there were
current at Rome certain cannino Marciano in Saturnian verse,
ascribed to a prophetie Marcius (as Livy xxv. ro, and Pliny
H. N. v11. 33 say), or to two brothers of the name according
to Cic. de Div. 1. 40, 8 , which foretold the defeat of Cannae,
and enjoined games in honour of Apollo. The date of these is
unknown, but cp. Weissenborn on Livy l.c.

a't. Albano ln monte: ‘quia Egeria nympha dicebatur
loqui cum Numa Pompilio in Albano monte’ Acron. This legend
does not ap ear elsewhere in quite the same form; but Ritter
labours hard³ to show that it is equivalent to that which places
the grove of Egeria at Aricia, which was not indeed on, but at
the foot of the Alban mount. Cp. Ov. Met. xv. 487, Servius
on Verg. Aen. vn. 763 eductum Egeriae lucis. Ov.·Fast. 111.
abr-o. He is however clearly wrong in supposing this grove
at Aricia to be that mentioned in Juv. 111. 17, which was
close to the Capene gare at Rome, sixteen miles away. Burn
