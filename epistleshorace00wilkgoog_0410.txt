no authority. It is ira pi, not μή, ashe rightly takes it. Inthe
Medea ol Euripides, the eries nithe children, as they are being
murdered behind the soenes, are heard by the audience (vv. 1271,
ram: the chorus tells Jason os their sate lv. 1309), and then
Medea ap ars in a chariot drawn by dragous, with the bodies
of the chihderen (v. 1317). In Seneca's play, in spite ol the
rule of Horace, the murder took place on the stage.

187. Procne, according to the Greek form of ¹the story, was
changed into a nightingale, Philomela, her sister, into a swallow:
the Romans generally made Philomela the nightingale, and Pro·
cne the swallow, perhaps wrongly connecting the name ol the
former with μέλις. Cp. Wagner and Conington on Verg. Ecl.
vr. 7 . The legend is most sully given by Ovid Met. vr.
412—67 , and best discussed by Preller Gr. Myra. 11. 140-144·

Cadmus ln mnam: cp. Μ. Arnold Empedocles on Etna:

And there, they say, two bright and aged snakes,

divided into ἐπεισόδια witha πρόλογος and an ἔξοδος, divided
by'choric songs (cp. Aristot. Poet. c. xrr. [perhaps an interpola·

In the Oedipus Tyrannus lor instance there are six ‘episodes',
