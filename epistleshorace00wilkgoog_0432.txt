would rather keep my tanay as a critic, and teaclr others, attt-
out attempting verse myself.

surore Democritus quemquam poetam magnum turpasse, quad
idem dicit Plato (sc. Phaedr. 245 Α ὃς δ’ ον ἄνευ μανίας Μουσῶν
ἐπὶ ποιητικὰς θύρας ἀφίκηται, πεισθεὶς tiriae έκ τέχνης ἱκανὰς
ποιητὴς ἐσόμενος, ἀτελὴς airo'r re rai ἡ ποίησις ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν μαινο-
μένων ἡ τοῦ σωφρονοῦντος adnotatio: cp. Thompson's note): and
similarly in de Orat. 11. 46, 194 (see note there). According to
Diog. Laert. tx. 7, 48 Democritus wrote a book on poetry, in
which something like Plato‘s words may have been found. Cp.
Cic. pro Arch. 8, 18 accepimus..poctam...quasi divina quodam
spiritu instrati) Sat. 11. 7, 117.

Ter. Eun. 123: Cicero has it in his dialogues (de Orat. 11. 3, 14)
not in his speeches. It strikes one as a somewhat colloquial
usage: hence the phrase in the Odes may not be really parallel,
though Wrckham takes it so. nou ungule ponere, ie. neglecta
persona] appearance, cp. Ep. 1. 7, 50 (note). Schtitz quotes
Tatian’s description of the Cynics (adv. Graecos, p. 87) κόμην ’

298. barbani, properly me mark of a philosopher (Sat. 11.
3, 35 sapientem pascere barbam), but allowed to grow by all who
were careless of their appearance. The public baths were great
centres lor social reunion. ’

299. murmur: the indefinite subiect ‘a man’is supplied
rather awkwardly after bana pars: hence Ribbeck suggesye to

³⁰⁰. nnumin: hellebore grew abundantly at Anticyra in
Phocis, a town on a small peninsula, to the east of the Crisaean
Gulf. It was not far removed from Cirrha, butI doubt the con·
nexion between the names which Prof. Palmer assumes (on Sat.
11. 3, 82). Many persons came to reside there for medical treat-

at the head ol the Maliac Gall, and it is asserted (but only on
the late authority of Stephanus) that hellebore grew there too,
and that the natives professed to have eured Heracles ol his
madness. An attempt has been made (sanctioned even in the
Dict. Geogr. and in Kiepert's maps) to discover a third Anticyra
to suit this passage by straining an expression in Livy xxvr. 26,
in which Anticyra is said to be in Locris: but even the text
there is doubtful, and the words breme margarit a Naupacto est
