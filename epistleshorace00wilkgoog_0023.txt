ne. 2'0. ls there'anything t'o point to a' later date
than this? In the Epistles thern'selves there seems to
be nothing It is a very doubtful 'conjecture which
finds in Ep. i. 17, 33—35 areference to the triumphs
os Augustus and Agrippa in nc 19. But we have
also totake into consideration the relationof the
’ EpistlesptotherOdes. It seems 'pretty well established
that the first three books of the Odes were published
together, before any ol the Epistles; indeed, the lan·
gnage which Horace uses in Ep. i. 1, and the refer-
ence to imitators in Ep. i. 19, alike force us to the
assumption of a tolerably long⁴ interval between the
publication os the Odes and that' of the Epistles. Now
the date ol the publication of Odes ‚l-iii. does not
admit of. exact determination :There are arguments
which seem to point very strongly tornc 2'4 or 23:
there are others which have been considered to point
to nc* 19 (cp. chkhanr’s Introduction to the Odes,
Christ's Fastorum HoralthnorumEpim'sti, Kirchner's
QuaestionesHoraltonac,a1id F ranko’s Fasti Horatiana).
But on the whole the evidence thr the earlier year·
decidedly preponderates. It.is therefore. probable
that we rnay assume nc 20, or at the latest nc 19‚as
the date of the publication os the· first book os the
Epistles¹.
² If we are to accept Μι· Venall's' very ingenious, but'not
very convincing argument sot the publication of Odes i.·-iii.
in nuc 19, it is not necessary perhaps to alter the date ol the

r publication ol the Epistles3 but 1t would affect the interpretation
