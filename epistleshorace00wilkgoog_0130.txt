Janus. from the top to the bottom ’. We may notice however rt
passage in Livy XLI. ay et sorum porticibus tabernisque claudem
dum. et Ianos tres faciendos, which somewhat supports Becker’s
theory: the name 01 the town in question is lost, the passage
being much mutilated; bnt it is possible that the constructions
described were in imitation of those at Rome: they were cer·
tuinly not at Rome, as Mr King (on Phil. VI. 51 su poses. For
the phrase summus ab imo=‘from the top to the ttom'‚ cp.

56. laevo...1eeorto, a line repeated from 83116, 74 and
rejected by many recent editors. But it is found in all Mss,
and may perhaps be defended as heightming the irony: old and
young all repeat the same lesson, like a pack of school-boys, on

their way to school—auam! toculos, Roby§ 1126, S.Gs§ 471·

and in most good MSS. The usual order is due to CruquiuS,

vailed with most recent editors. I feel by no means sure that
Ritter is not right in preferring the other order, which is far
better established, and which gives a Horatian abruptness. The
reading si for sedis weakly supported3 so is Bentley’s desint for
desunt. ·

‘credit ’, that is, a respectable position in money matters, though
not quite up to the standard for a knight (cp. Ep. 1. 6, 36),
01 perhaps better ‘loyalty' to your friends, to be connected
clsosely with lingua, and hence not, as Orelli thinks, tautologous
