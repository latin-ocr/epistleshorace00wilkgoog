EPISTLE XV.

This Epistle must have been written aster the famous ,
physician Antonius Musa had brought the coldwater treatment
mto iashion by his cure of Angustus in the year nc. ης and
{Obably not long aiter, although the arguments by which

'tter attempts to fix the date as the autumn of nc. 21 are
more in enious than convincing. Horace writes toa friend, who
is call in the MSS. inscriptions C. Nnmonius Vela, to tell hlrn
that he cannot spend the coming winter, as he had previously
done, at Baiae, and to make enquiries about Velia and alernnm. y
He humorously compares himself to a certain Maenius who
liked to have the best of sare, when he could get it, but put up
readily with plain dishes, when nothing better offered.
