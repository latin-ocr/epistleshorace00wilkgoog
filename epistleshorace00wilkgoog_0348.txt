humorously represents the stoek o poems which they bring and

alternately inflict upon each other, drawing out mutual compli- “

ments, but really inflicting painlul weariness, as inexhaustible.

ballot had been introduced in the election ol magistrates, it was l
the custom lor the voting-tablets to be distributed by rogatores: 3

these were then marked by the voters, and placed in astae,
from which they were taken out and sorted by diribitores. That
these then reported the results to.certain custodes, who (as

the number given for each candidate', is a very doubtful ine

shows plainly that the punctum cannot have been used merely
to record a vote already given. On the other hand, the voting·
