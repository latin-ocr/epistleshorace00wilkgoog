and they must have been familiar to Augustus long before any
date plausibly assigned to any one oi the Epistles. For the
story told by Suetonius which Ritter here presses into his serviae
see the Introduction to Ep. 11. 1.

1-9. Give my valamer, Vinius, ta Augustus, ifyaufiua' lu
is in the hunraurfar them, but da not annay nim by obtrusiueness.
fiyssssrdm is tao niuali far you, drap u rather tizan deliuer it

2. reddeat Ep. 1. ro, 44 (note). viat: the MS. evidence
is in favour of Vinni, but inscriptions have Vinius, and this form
is the one used by Tacitus (Hist. 1. 1) and Suetonius (Galba xiv.)
for Galba’s colleague in the consulship. .

3. validus: Augustus was always a valetudinarian (Suet.
Aug. Lxxx1. grows et pniculesas valetudines peromnem vitam
aliquot expertus est), and had several serious illnesses at this
time of his lise. Cp. Sat. 11. s, -18 nisi ‚dextro tempore Flacci
verba per attentam nan ibunt Caesaris 'aurem ,· Ov. Trist. 1. 1. 92
si pateris [sc. liber] vacua tradi, si cuneta videli's insilia, si vires
fregerit ira suas.

4. ne peccem Sat. 11. 3, 88 ne sis patruus mini shows that
this may be taken as a negative imperative; but it may quite

as well be regarded us final. Cp. Roby§ 1600 (note), S· G. ἓ 668.

5. sedulus ‘officious’: cp. Ep. 11. t, 260, Sat. 1. 5. 71.
opere. vehemente ‘by your impetuous zeal ’.

dl uret ‘galls’, Ep. 1. 10‚43. swalna: the quantity os the
p'tipnptppyecpccounted for by the fact that sarcia has also the shorter

eurem: ‘In Catullus' days the Romans medmlypapyrns
never parchment, ior a regular liber or volumem. Books made
up like ours and written on parchment seem to have come into
use about Martial's time.’ Mnaso on Catullus p. 53.

t. perterre like abicito has sor its object sarcinam, not
clitellas. as Ritter takes it. To qua supply the antecedent ibi,

to go with inpingas ‘dash down ’. ¹
8. ierus ‘wildly ', like an unbroken animal.

9. noua ‘the talk of the town’: cp. Epod. xl. 8 sabinia
quanta fui.

10-19. Pusli an to Rome: but dan’t carry my book like a
clmun, a drunken slave-girl, ar a lumlle guest ‚· martell every
mre ihatyau are an your way ta Caesar. Tau gaad care af it.

10. lemur ‘lacunas maiores, continentes aquarn pluviam
seu caelestem, irinati λαιμοῦ, quae ingluvies est et vorago viarum
