a cnrious story (V. H. IV. 4), ‘I hear that there is a law at
Thebes enjoining all artists, and painters, and sculptors, to
¹ improve upon their subjects in representing them. The law
¹ threatens with a penalty those who in sculpture or painting
represent them as nglier than they are’ (τοῖς eis rb χεῖρόν ποτε η
albacara ἢ γράψασι). There is of course no reference here to
intentional caricature.

265. proponi corona ‘to be exposed as a warren image’:
i.e. to havea caricatured portrait of myself offered for sale. It
was customary to make the imagines of deceased ancestors of
wax (Plin. H. N. xxxv. a, 6 expressi cera voltus singulis dis·

ponebantur armariis); and the art may naturally have been
transferred to living persons of celebrity. Sometimes these were
made by means of a plaster cast taken from the face of the
subject. Cp. Marqnardt Rom. Privatalt. 1. 246. 'lhere is a
very life-like wax mask to be seen in the Musenm at Naples
(Mus. Borbon. xv. 54) which was found in a tomb at Cumae:
it still has traces of paint upon the face. cp. Daremberg
and Saglio's Dict. fig. 1291.

267. placui ‘stupid’: Sat. 11. 6, 14.

nna cum scriptore meo: Horace does not seem to mean
more than ‘I should be involved in the disgrace which will
come upon the poet who makes me his theme, when his worth·
, less poem issent off to be used for waste paper’. The sug·
gestion that he may mean ‘bust and poem alike would be
discarded as rubbish' does not seem so good.

r 268. capsa properly a book-case (Sat. 1. 4, aa),here hu·
morously put for a bier.

porrectus, stretched out at length like a corpse. opem is
the reading of all MSS. of any importance, and may well be
defended. Sometimes a corpse was carried out to burial onan
open couch or bier (lectra, feretrum), sometimes in a coffin

(capulio) carried on a frame (sandapila), cp. Marqnardt Privat-
alt. 1. 3603 and the latter was the more usual with the poorer
classes3 Becker, Gallust 111. 364. Many recent editors prefer
aperta, which Orelli thinks denotes more contempt: but the
reverse is the case, if we are to-accept the analogy of funerals.

269. mcum, probably the vicus Tuscus of Sat. 11. 3, 228.

2⁷⁰. outcome: Pers 1. 43 adds mackerel: nec scombros
maurntrb carmina nec tus ,· which he gets from Catuli. xcv.7
Volusi annales...loxas scombros saepo dabunt tunicas. Our
modern equivalent is to be found in the trunk·makers and
pastrycooks. Cp. Martia} vl. 60, 7 Quam multi tincas pascunt
blattasque diserti, ct redimunt soli carmina docta coqui, 111. o, 4
ne...turis piperisque sis cucullus. .
