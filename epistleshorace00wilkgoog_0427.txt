2⁸8. non quim Cicero judges more favourably the per·
ception oi a popular audience: cp. de Orat. 111. 50, 196 at in
pglgrplcgnnetm et modisJ, sipontum modo offeram cst, theatra tota

2⁶4. ot...poottr ‘and indulgence is granted to Roman poeta,
which poets ought not to need’. Peerlkamp, thinking that this
line and the preceding one contain an objection made to
Horace’s too great strictness, to which he replies in the following
line, reads nec dota, etc. and Schiitz niuch approves. But the
lines are justas well taken as a concession inade by Horace:
⁴1 admit that etc-⁹ poena is strictly the dative, but requires to
be understood again as an ablative aster indrgna.

s ‘ren vager ‘am I to move unchecked by lawi’ an: Bentley
adopted the reading ut, which has very slight authority, carrying
on the question, and interpreting: ‘All the audience do not
notice saults, and those who do, excuse thern. Ain Ι therefore
deliberately to de art from the rules oi art, and write carelessly,
feeling sure that isbali be saie, in my cantion within the limits

oi the indulgence granted, even though I should suppose that
every one will see my iaults’. This makes good sense: but it
isnot necessary to depart from the MSS. It is equally good to
interpret: ‘Or arn I to assume that all will notice my saults,
and therefore avoid them, cautiously keeping within the sphere

in which I may hope for indulgencei’ T e latter is the alterna·
tive to be chosen: but Horace immediately goes on to say that
this is not enough oiitscli. The Greek models show that more
than a mere avoidance of faults is needed ior excellence. Ribbeck
puts the mark oi interrogation at mea, and joins tutus...cautur
with vitavi: this would be an improvement, is it were not sor
the awkwardness ol datique coming so late in the sentence.
Orelli's view ‘Or falling into the opposite error, am Ito suppose
that all will see my faults, but none the less consider myself
saie from censure provided Ι take care that no verses which
are too rough or absolutely unmetrical drop from me constantlyi'
does not bring out sufficiendy the contrast of the two alternatives:
the latter in his interpretation is merely equivalent to scribere
licenter. In this case he could hardly be sard vitavisse cultam.

For taetus ‘cautious’ cp. v. 28.
