Rama, Marone ; but in the former passage this meaning is very
improbable, while in the latter the point of the epigram ab·
solutely requires that we should interpret ‘during the life-time
of Vergil '. Itis not 'more possible for imolumz's to bear this
sense (although even Mr Yonge admits it) than it would be for

us to say that a man was faring well, to indicate that some one
had said ‘farewell' to him.

temptavit, the form best supported orthographically seems
to be due to an early popular confusion with contemptus, etc.
Etymologically the form should be tento, as e frequentative from ζ
tendo. Cp. Roby 5964. Corssen1.² raa. ν

224. ,motusque nerle: Dramatic representations at dhe
Dionysiae festivals began very early in the morning (cp. Arist.
Av. 784 ff, Aesch. in Ctes. p. 467, Dein. in Mid. p. 538): it is
commonly said that the satyrio dramas were exhibited towards
the evening: this is quite inconsistent with the prevalent doctrine
as to the production of plays in tetralogies, unless, indeed, ench
poet had a whole day to himself, as Bergk (Gr. Lr't· tn. p. 24)
thinks; but cousidering the slight support which that doctrine
has (cp. Journal of Philolngy vn. cyp-292) this is nota serious
objection *Bergk holds (Gr. Lit. 111. 19 ff.) that originally
comedies only were produced at the Lenaea, and tragedies at
the Great Dionysia, but that at a later time the comedies were
preceded by tragedies‚ and the tragedies by comedies, so in·
ἷῑὲἓὲῗὲῖἱὲἓξ trientstrathteihten(tte-10⁵remit
may have been played towards the evening‚ when they no longer
formed part of a tetralogy (if they ever did). That they fre·
quently were played independently is clear from the statement
of Suidas that Pratinas wrote fifty plays, of which thirty· two were
satyrio-We do not know when the sacrifices, wit which a
banquet was always associated, were offered: perhaps during the
interval for the second or later ἄριστον (Bergk 111. p. 31), which
may have come between the tragedies and the satyric dramas.
At the Dionysia it was considered the duty of all loyal wor-
shippe'rs of the deity to drink freely, ‘and reeling own the mighty
wine-god’s power’ (Becker Clean'cles, p. 178). Cp. Plato Leg. vr.

οἶνον δόντος θεοῦ ἑορταῖς.

special enactment. , , ,
