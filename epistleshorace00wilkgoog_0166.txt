126 HORA TI EPISTULAE. ,

1. ull adinum corresponds to Tennyson’s ‘wise indifference
ol the wise ’, the ἀταραξία of the Epicureans, sor opud Epicurum
duo borco sunt, ex quibus summum illuri beatu ue componitur,
ut corpus siue dolore sit, animus sine perturbatione Seneca Ep. 66, ,
45), the ἀπάθεια ol the Stoics, to whom all emotions were sor-
bidden (Cic. Acad. 11. 43, 135), except in the modilied form of
εὐπάθειαι (Zeller, Stoics, pp. 253, 291). The admirari would
naturally bring along with it the optare and expetere, with which
it is olten conjoined3 eg. Cic. de Off. Ι. oo, 66, where one of
the marks os a ‘fortis animus et magnus' is cum persuasum est
nihil hominem nisi quod honesturn decorumque sit out adrnirari
aut aptare aut expetere oportere.

³. hunc ‘yon'.

a momentis ‘courses’, the τροπὴ ol Epicurus in Diog.
Laertae 76, notos time,asinSat. 1. 1. 7. Cp. Ep. 1. ro, 16.

tormidine ‘dread ', i-e. superstitious alarin.

h. imbuti: cp. Ep. Ι. 2, 69 (note), and Cic. de Fin. 1. 18,6o
superstitio, quo gui est imbutus, quietus esse nunquam potest:

quid merely introduces the questiones in Cic. de off. 11. 7, 25
quid censemus supercorcm illum Dionysium, qno cruciatu tinnris
angi solitum? de Orat. Ι. 17, 79 quid censes, si ad alicuius inge·
nium uel maius illa, quoe ego non ottc'gi, accusarint, qualem illurn
ct quantum oratorem futurum? pro Rosc. 17, 49 quid censes
hunc nsunt Sex. Roscium, quo studio ct quo intelligentia esse in
rusticis rebus? Maeleane’s interpretation ‘what do you suppose
they think' &o is quite baseless.

’1. numentanorum, ete. This line has beenpunctuated
and explained in at least five different ways: (r) ludicra quid,
plausus, ludicro being then translated ‘games’t the objections
to this are (a) that although the singular is often so used,
there is no authority sor the plural; but cp. Madw'g on Cic.
de F in. 1. ro, 69: (b) that with ct following, another copula
is needed before plausus: (c) that, if the games are regarded
from the stand-point of the givet, they are not naturally an

object of admiration; if from the spectator’s point of view, there

isan abruptness in passing on to the prizes o ambition. (α) lu-
dicro quid plausus, plausus being the genitive after ludicra ‘the
toys of applause', ie. ‘worthless applause’, like otia rerum,
strato viarum etc. Then line 7 refers to the prizes of ambition,
as munera...Indos to those os covetousness. But (α) plausus is not
a word which lends itsels naturally to this genitival construction:
(b) it is not likely that Horace, in asking a question asto the
salue to be set upon these things, would imply his own opinion
