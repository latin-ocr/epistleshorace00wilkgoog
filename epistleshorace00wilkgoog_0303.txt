assumed that this rs the period meant. But Schiitz obj ects (ι)
that art and literature had reached ahigh development before
this datez (a) that after this time, when all arts were at their
height, the Greeks carried on lierce wars with each other. He
therefore lays stresson nugari and vitium as indicating blame,
not sufficiently accounted for by the manner in which the more
rigid Romans were accustomed to regard the acconrplishments ιιι
which the Greeks excelled3 and considers that‘ wars were laid
aside’ only after Greece lost lrer ιιιιιερειιᾶειιεε, and a ‘kindly
fortune’ preserved her from civil strif e hythe peace which Rome
imposed upon hersubjects.1n su port of this vrew it may be
urged that Horace' rs not speaking ol) the excellence attained by
Greece' ιιι various departments of art, but only of the capricions·
ness with which, like a spoilt child, she turned froin one amuse-
ment to another But it is hard to believe that fortuna aequa
can refer to the time of the national degradation of Greece, and
not to the prosperity and vigorons national life which followed
the repulse of the barbarians. And though Horace rs not grvrng
unqnalified praise to the pursuits of the Greeks, he rs certainly
commendingtlre versatility which led them to try so many forms
of mental activity, and so caused the productiori os the new
