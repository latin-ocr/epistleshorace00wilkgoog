¹ 20. linei vin: this road ismentioned again in cte. ad
Att. tx. 6: cohortesque sex, quae Albae fuissent, ad Curium
Mimo transisse. Now by comparing Caes. Β. C.1. 24, where
the same fact is mentioned, with c. 15 of the same book, it is
clear that the cohorts were not at Alba longa, but at Alba on
the Fucine Lake Hence Macleane has quites wrong conception
of this road when he speaks oi it as running between the via
latina and theria Appia, about half-way between Tusculum
and Aricia. indeed a glauce at the map will show that there ir
no room for a high road between theria Latina, which runs
along one side of the Mons Albanus and the via Appia, which
,under the other The via Astaunitmuu therefore have
en either another name for the via Valeria, whlch led through
Tibur to Alba and Corfinium, and so on to the sea at Aternum,
or perhaps more probably sor a partulit. From Strabo (vl.
. 283) we learn that there were two roads from Beneventum to
Brundisium, one, the Appian road, ‘passing through Tarentum,
and better adapted sot carriages, the 'other adapted only lor
mules, passing through Herdonia, Canusium 'and Egnatia. The
latter was that taken by Maecenas and his suitezon the journey
described byllorace in Sat. 1. 5. Mr Bunbury (Dict. Geog. 11.
128'2 at thinks it ‘not improbable' that this‘was the Via, Minucia:
Schiitz (on Hor. Sat. 1. 5, 77) states the same view positively3
Prof. Palmer suggests that the road srom Beneventum to Canu·
sium was a cross=road connecting the two great roads This
last view is the only one which I can reconcile with the words
of Cicero taken in connexion with Caesar’s account. ‘The nature
of the fountry does¹ not admit os a road straight from Alba to
Beneventum, and there is no indication of such a road in the
Itineraries. The statement of some editors that the Via Minucia
was constructed by Ti. Minucius the· consul of nc. 305 (Lim
tx. 44) seems to rest on no authority, and is withdrawn by Orelli
in his later editions.
