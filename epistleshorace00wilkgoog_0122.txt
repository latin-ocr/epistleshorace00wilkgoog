tinguishing himself in the arena. A large number of these
tesserae have been discovered: ‘Ex osse eboreve sunt omnes,
exiguae molis, ansatae et ad gestandum appendendumve aptae,
formae longiusculae quadratae excepta unica recentissima sex
laterum. Singulis lateribus singuli versus inscripti sunt, ut a quo
incipias arbitrarium sit.¹ Mommsen Corp. lnscr.Lat. 1. p. 195·
Mommsen was inclined, sor various reasons, to doubt the current
opinion that these were presented at the close of a successful
fight, but there is some fresh support for this view in the recent
discovery of a bronze tablet recording a presentation probably of
this kind: cp. Corp. 11. 4963, (where it is fignred), Wilmanns
Ex. Inscr. Lat. 11. p. 239. Ritschl has discussed the tesserae
very fully and supported the old view in Opusc. 1v. 572 ff.
Cp. Friedli'tnder Sitteng. 11³ 510. It is to be noticed that some
have the word spectavit (never spectatus) in full z of these six are
now known to exist (cp. Ephem. Epigr. 111. 161, ²033 Garrucci
Syll. p. 651 and Tav. 11. 7). Mommsen thinks that spectavit may
mean ‘took his place as a spectator,' no longer in the arena.

donatum tam rude ‘already discharged ’r the medis was the
wooden foil with which gladiators practised Liv. xxvi. 51, 43 and
hence a radis was presented to a veteran as a sign that he was
no longer to take part in serious encounters. Cp. Suet. Calig. 32
Murmillonem c ludo nedibus secum botuenlem ct sponte prostratum
confodit ferrea rica ; and for the applied meaning Cic. Phil. 11.
