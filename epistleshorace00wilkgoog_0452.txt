41² ARS POETICA.

selideuial for their public appearances‚ but novadays men are
satisfied with saying that they would account it a disgrace not to
be able to write poetry, even though they have never studied the
art'. Ritter, Schiitz, Keller, Krtiger, Dillenbiirger and others
retain nunc, the Scholiasta knew uo other reading, and Conington
evidently adopts it for his translation. lf any correction were
needed, I should prefer Jeep's huic to Bentleys nec.

att. occupet extremum roubian ‘deuce take the hind-
most¹: according to Porphyrion ‘hoc ex lusu puerorum sustulit,
qui ludentes solent dicere: quisquis ad me novissimus venerit,
habeat scabieru’. L. Miiller has rearranged the line, so as to
make a trochaic tetrameter catalectic‚ like that quoted in Ep. r.

endeavours to attract urchasers by promising them good bur·
gaius3 a rich man, wito writes verse, attracts an audience ot'
flatterers by the hope that they will gaiu something. Hence
v. 4²¹ is not superfluous, as Schiitz thinks, but necessary to the
meaning. It is repeated from Sat. 1. a, r 3 in a different con·
nexion, just as Ep. 1. 1, 56 is repeated from Sat. 1. 6, 74, and
Sat. t. 4, 92 from Sat. 1. a, 27, though the last instance is not
quite parallel. The satirists are full oi instances in which a
dinner was the reward ior listening to the host's poetry= e. g.
Mart. 111. r haec tibi, non alia, est od cenam causa vocandi, versi·
culos recites ut, Lagarim, tuos,· etc. e cp. 11. 27, 111. 45, vtt. 42,
tx. 14.

422. ut vero eat: vero does not here introduce a climax, as
Schiitz thinks, but is sim ly adversative: a rich poet cau get
plenty of admirers, but I s be surprised, if he can tell a true
friend from a deceiver.

motum: Ep. 1. 15, 44. ponere ‘serve up’: Sat. 11. a, ²3³
4, 143 6, 64 ; 8, 913 Pers. 1. 53 calidum sce‘sponere acmen.

428. levi ‘oilittle credit'=levifide.· the word has no reser-
ence here to moral character. But as this use is rare of persons,
and as pauperis very seldom accompanied.b an epithet, Geel
has ingeniously conjectured velit. Words 1· e modo and domo
are frequently confused. Cp. Plaut. Most. 432 (Sonu.=417
