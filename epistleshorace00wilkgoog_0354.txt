314 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

m. ludentis, ‘oi one in sport'‚ not‘oi an aetor': et

As the proverb has it, ‘easy writing makes hard reading'‚ so
a writer to seem at his ease, must put forth all his powers. One
of the most striking illustrations is Addison's style, which
attained its consummate ease only aiter the most caresul revision.
Pope has again caught the point admirablyt

But ease in writing flows from art, not chance,
As those move easiest who have learn’d to dance.

The apparent ease oi motiouof the trained dancer is dne only
to long continued effort.

The Satyr would dance tightly, the yclops heavily and clumsily:
cp. Carm. 1. 1, 31 nynplaarumque leves cum Satyris chri.
Sat. 1. 5, 63 pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat: Verg. Ecl.
