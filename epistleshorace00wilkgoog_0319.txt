nl. 11. Ep. 1.] ¹ Noenu 279

plebecula, used by Cic. only in adAtt. 1. 16, rr. Pers. 1v. 6
as usual imitates Horace. Suet. Vesp. xvm. puts the word
into the mouth of Vespasian: simret se plebeculam pascere, witha
notion ¹of contempt, and perhaps also as a specimen of the rough
language of the low-born emperor.

187. equitis: Bentley reads equiti, which is perhaps a more

ι usual construction, but not to be thrust upon lintace against'the

MSS.

188. hortos ‘wandering', turning restlessly from one
object to another, and therefore not caring to give the fixed
attention needed for a drama, notaccompanied by much spec·
tacular display. ,Bentley’s emendation ingratos has deservedly
found little approval.

² 189. amasa, from allata, derived according to Servius on
Verg. Georg. 111. 25, ‘ab aula Attali inqua primum inventa
sunt vela ingentia’. It is more probable that the word meant
originally the portilre of a hall. In the theatrc the curtain was
dropped at the beginning of the performance below the level of
the stage, and raised at the conclusion. Cp. Verg. G. 1. c.;
Ov. Met. 111. 111 sic ubi tolluntur sistis aulaea theatris: Cic. pro'
Cael. 27, 65 deinde scabilla corrompant: atelaeum tollitur, i. e.
all is over. All MSS. here have acoleo, which Keller is inclined
to think Horace may have written. But the confusion between
ae and ccame in as early as the first century after Christ, and
it is better to follow the truc orthography.

⁴ premuntur ‘are kept down ’.

, 190. innunt ‘are flying across the stage'‚ with no notion of
night, as Orelli supposes. Cicero writIng to Marius (Ep. Fam.
vu. 1, a) says quo qualem apparatu non dubito quin animo
aequissimo carueris: quid enirn delectationis labent sexcenti muli
s‘n Clytaemnestra aut in Equo Troiano creterrarum tria milia
aut armatura uaria peditatus et equitatur iu aliqua pugna?
' quae popularem adnuiraloonem habuerunt, delectationem tibi

nullum attulissent. .

191. ressnmtortuna=reges infortunati.

192. meaa ‘chariots', light open two-whecled carriages,
said to have been used first by the Belgae (Caes. B. G. IV. 33,
v. 16) and employed by the Britons as war-chariore

oflensa ‘carriages', covered two-wheeled vehicles‚ ’ easily
swinging (and thirs connected with pilum the‘swung’ or hurled
weapon, Vanideh Diet. p. 1184) auri used for ladies (‘quibus
vehuntur reginae captivae ', Acron), and for religious proces·
srons.
