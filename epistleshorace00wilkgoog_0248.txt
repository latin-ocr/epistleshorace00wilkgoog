208 HORATI EPISTULAE.

ῐιιιο paui ‘is right in secking ’.

ta-ot One who es poying court to a great mon should
obstoin from (ι) direct begging (43-51)‚ond more indirect
ottonpts to extract money (52-62), or real causes of complaint
will not meet with attention.

4³. ιιι has far less authority than suo,· but Bentley and
Lachmann (Lucret. ..p 238) seem right ιιι preferring the former.
Keller and Schutz think an epithet rs more required with rego,
used ιιι the transferred sense of‘ patron’‚ than with paupertate,
which can stand alone, the limitation, which οι course is neces·
s,ary being then supplied by the context. Cp. Plaut Stich.
454 tom confido, quarn potis, meum me optenturum regem ridi-
cu ιι logis. But ιι 1s certa1nly more pointed to say ‘those who
say nothing before a patron of their own poverty': and the
great probability that suo would be assimilated to rege by tran·
scnbers, influenced, it may be, by the caesura, outweighs‘ ιιι
this case the MS evidence.

to. aruo etc ‘but this was the main point, this the source
os your conduct': ιιιι not, as Macleane, ‘this' is the pointl
was coming to but ‘the point which we had ιιι uiew', iuvv.
11, ιι, viz. to getas much as possible ootol your patrois.

ιι. ιιιοιιιι. ιο allow a siste 'tomarry without a proper
dowry‚ was regarded as a greatd ace. cp. Plaut. Trin. 89
ne ιιιι 'hone famomff diff erant, me germanam meam sororem ιιι
coeuubinotum tebi si sine dote dem, dedisse magis quom in oratri-
mone'um. quis me intprobrorperleibeoturesse? lroec famigeratio
te honestet, me conlutulentet, ιι sine dote duxeris.

et. noo vendibilis ‘not saleable’ 1..e I can find no pur-
chaser for it: there rs no need to suppose, with some editors,
that there was any legal obstacle to the sale.

pascere firmus· another of Horace‘s savourite infinitives
after an adjective. cp. Ep. 1. 15, 30 (note). firmus: ‘',saie
‘lrtrustworty'. ,

joining in the cry.

49. ‘et mthtt¹ Itis best with Porphyrion, Keller, Schiitz
and Kriiger to take these words alone, as the cry ot the' second
hettttl‘ttt.,tltittthhhhtthg{thirle
mendici impudentia, which Orelli finds here. Translate ‘the
calce will be divided, and the gift parted between you’. Horace
means ‘if you beg so shamelessly, you will attract the attention
of others, and so you will have to share with thern, what other·
wise you might have kept all to yourself'.
