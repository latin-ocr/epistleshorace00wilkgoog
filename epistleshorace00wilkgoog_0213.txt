Bk Ι. Ep. XIIL] NOTES. ' 123

trtnmts properly means a man of the same tribe, and perhaps
it is best taken so here, the notion being that a wealthy man at
Rome has invited to dinner a poor member of tbe same tribe,
living in the country, doubtless with a view to his vote and
‚interests But as the tribus came to be used in contrast with the
equites and me Senate (cp. Mart. vm. 15, 3 dat populus, dat
gratus eques, dat tura Senatus, et ditant Latias tertre dona tribus)
so tribulis acquired the meaning oi plebeian: cp. Mart. lx. 50,
7 oi a toga nunc anus et tremulo vix accipienda tribuli, ib. 58, 8.
Hence it is possible that this may be the meaning heret but we
bave no evidence of this force of the word in the time ol Horace.
-The humble guest comes bringing under his arm the dress-shoes
(soleae) in which he would be expected to appear in the dining·
room, although he would put them off when he took his place at
table (Sat. 11. 8, 77), and the felt cap which he would need when he
went home at night. He cannot afford to come in a litter, nor
even to have a slave to attend upon him.

1⁶. lle seems to have sar more support than Bentley's neu
or L. Miiller's nec and there is something not unpleasant in the
abruptness, even it we retain the semi-colon at Caesares. The
stress lies on the last word. Vinius is not to tell everybody that
the reason why he is in such hot haste is that he ison his way
to Augustus.

narres, evidently imperative here. Cp. l. 4.

18. nitere porro, ‘push on’. Horace humorously supposes
that people will come crowding round his messenger, eager to
know what he has brought. Bentley ·(without remark, and
Orelli supposes, by accident) printed saltere. porro, and this read-
ing hasbeen adopted by some editors ; but nitere seems to
require an adverb much more‘than vade, and the rhythmis
certainly against the pause aiter the fifth foot. Forporro of place,
not time, cp. Liv.1. 7, 6 agere porra armentum occepit ,· rx. a, 8
si ire porro pergas.

19. cave, scanned, as so osten in Plautus and Terence, cdvi.-
. cp-,Satn- 3, 38, 1773 5, 753 the pronunciation cau. is not on
the whole so probable, though apparently supported by the story
in Cic. de Div. 11. 40, 84. Persius (1. 108) has vidis.. ’

amnes, often used, like our ‘ trip ', os blundering generally
(cp. Ter. Haut. 361 verum alla nequid titubet, and Plaut. Pseud.
939 at valle ne titubes, Mil. 248, 946 dcc), but here still keeping
up the jest oi v. 10: it an ass were to stumble and sall, he mi ht
smash his load, il fragile, as Horace represents his poetry toie.
At the same time, as Orelli points out, we find the phrases
fhcdus, fidem, iura or leges frangere. ·
