29. volpecula: Bentley protestn against this reading with
more than his usual energy. He calls upon lox-hunters, farmers
and men of science to bear witness that a fon could not eat corn
if he were never so hungry: he has not the teeth to do it with.
Besides no fon however lean could creep through a crevice iu a
coru-jar, unless it was large enough tolet all the curn out.
Again how could a fox, a creature haunting the woods, have got

' into a house at all, or have been content to remain within doors
long enough to be positively fattened in the com-jar? Besides
St Jerome expressly mentions a mouse in referring to the fable
by Aesop from which this is borrowed. Hence he confidently
restores nitedula ‘a shrewmouse’ for the present volpecula.
Many recent editors, and both Conington and Martin in their
translations, have followed him; but the soundest verdict has
been given by Munro (Introd. p. xxia), ‘Bentley's famous nile
dala for volpecula deserves all praise: it is brilliant; is what
Horace ought to have written r-but Isadly fear did not write,
not from ignorance probably, but because he had in his thoughts
some old-world fable, whose fores were not as our soxes’. We
might almost retort upon Lachmann, who strongly supports
Bentley (on Lucret. 111. 1014), in his own words ‘vocabulum

Horatio restitutum qui [non] accipiunt rationem et genera fabel· ' ³

larum ignorant ⁹. Keller aptly remarks that the list of animals

appearing in lables is a strictly limited one, that the fox often '

plays a part inconsistent with its natural habits, and finally that
a weasel would be more likely to eat a mouse than to give it
good advice! It moy be noticed that the weasel (γαλη) was
often tamed and kept in Greek and Roman houses on purpose
to keep down the nuce, the cat being comparatively rare, indeed
not commonly used as a domestic animal until the third or fourth
century uu. Cp. Academy Vol. x, p. 317, Houghtonfs Namral

8⁰. cumeram cp. Sat. 1. 1. 53, where Acron notes ‘c.
dicimus vas ingens vimineum, in quo frumenta conduntur...sive
cumerae dicuntur vasa fictilia similia doliis, ubi frumentum suum
reponebant agricolae'. pasta, the participle of the reflexive
form pascar, used actively. S. G. 5 567.

³1. toras ‘out’—of the eom-bin or of the house? The word
is in the vast majority of instances used of coming out of a
house ; but occasionally (eg. Caes. Β. C. 11. 11, 4: 14, 1). of e
