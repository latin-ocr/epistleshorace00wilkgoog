21. officium 100101 ‘I pay my court': for qfficia in this sense
’ cp. Ep. 1. 7‚8(note). .

vilis, verume, this is the reading ol the schonau, sup rted
t by all MSS. os any critical value, and is rightly adopted y the
best modern ed1tors, as Ritter, Schiitz and Keller, Munro being
the only important exception: vilia rerum might be defended
by ficta rerum Sat. 11. 8, 83, vana rerum Sat. 11. 1, 25. abdita
rerunt A. P. 49, antara curarum Carm. 1v. 11, 19 etc-z cp.
Munro on Lucr. 1¹. 315 strata viarum. But on the other hand
Horace is fond of ending a line with verum: cp. Sat.1.n,<92‚
Ep. 1. 1, 80, 11. 2, 70 (where some MSS. have rerum, as here,
against the sense), 106, A. Ρ. 303: hence there is no reason ior
de arting from the great preponderance os authority. The best
MgS. heve simply ommi ; some have verum es, which is more
likely to be a grammatical correction, and this is a case where
the harder reading is to be preferred. The construction appa-
rently is ‘tu poscis vilia, verum poscis dante minor', ie. but in
making your demand you place yoursell‘ in 'a position of inie-
riority to the bestower.

22. ter! ‘you boast'; Verg. Aen. v. 3'73 qui sc Bebrycia
veniens de genteferebat.

nullius is masculine: nemine occurs in Plaut. Capt. 761
(Bur), but fell out of use before the time of Cicero.

co or.

24. temptantem ‘aiming at’. praesentitur aequum: cp.
Carm. 111. 29, 33 quod adest, memento conrponere aequus. pree-
nunnus appears to be the dative 01 the neuter plural, ‘equal to
the circumstances ol the moment³; although Klotz (Βία.) talres
it as ablative‚ and some translators follow him, rendering ‘con-

ol aequus? e commentators as a rule ignore the difficulty.
tete Ep. 1. ⁶⁹. 9 (note). Diog. Laert. 31. 8, 66, says of Aristippus

211. duplici penno, the διπλοῖς 01 the Cymes, a large cloak
(abolla) also called τρίβων, worn doubled to serve at once aso
χιτών (innita) andxltapris (pallium). (ἳᾶ Mayor on Juv. 111.x

αι’ττῷ, πήραν τε ἐκομίσατο. Hence Diogenes is called by Cercidns -
(Diog. Laert. VI. 76) ὁ βακτροφόρας, διπλοείματος, αἰθεριβόσκας.

The words oi Diog. Laert. make it plain that we must under·
stand duplici literally, not, as sorn'e have taken it, ‘coarse’.
