BOOK 11.

EPISTLE Ι.

We have seen already from the First Book that the order in
which the Epistles were arranged for publication is not the
sameas that of the dates of their composition. As in publish-
ing the first three books of the Odes, the Epodes, the first book
of the Satires, and the first book of the Epistles, Horace placed
at the beginning a poem addressed to his patron Maecenas, so he
may have wished to give the first place in this second boolr to an
Epistle addressed to Augustus, although this may not have been
the earliest to be written. We have therefore to look for other
indications of its date. Ritter thinks that he has found two “
such. On the kalends oi August in rac. ra an altar was
dedicated at Lugdunum to Augustus: cp. Suet. Claud. 11:
Claudius naacscst...Kal. Aug. Luguduni, eaipso die qua primm
ara ibi Augusto &diruta est: Liv. Epit. cxxxvm. ara diui
Caesaris ad confluentem Araris ct Rhodani dedicata: Dio Cass.

to Fortuna Redux was decreed in honour of Au stus by the
Senate (Mon. Ancyr. c. 11): if any special reerence is in·
tended‚ it is more likely that this is intended. But Sueto·
nius (Aug. c. er.) says provinciarum pleraeque super templa
et aras ludas quoque quinquennales paene oppidatim conm-
tucrum,- and although this refers doubtless mainly to a later
portion of his reign, the custom may have begun early. Hence
no conclusion can safely be drawn from the phrase in v. 16.

Another argument hasbeen drawn from v. 255. Dio Cass.
(rw. 36) tells how in the winter of rae. rr-ro the Senate
docreed that the temple of Janus should be closed; but this q
