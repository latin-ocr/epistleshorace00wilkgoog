ol Plautus and Terence into five acts' is due only to‘the granu
metiens, and is osten very unskilfully made (cp. Lorenz Einlet'·
tang eur Mostellaria, p. 17); perhaps it is due only to this dic'-
tamin Horace. The modern division into acts dates from the
edition ol J. Β. Pius‚'Mitan‚ 1500 ff. (Teuffel, Rom. Lit. 586).
But Donatus praff. Ter. Adelph. says haec etiam ut cetera huius·
remedi poemata quinque actus habeat necesse est claris diadas a
Graecis pactis, quas etsi retinendi causa iant inconditas spectatores
minime dr'stingatunt Latini comici...tamen a doctis veteribus dis-
creti atquc disiuncti sunt. Still there were no doubt pauses in
the action of most, if not oi all plays; and these were filled up
by the music oi the flate-player. Cp. Plaut. Pseud. 574 R. (at
the end os Act l.) Tibicen aas interea iric delectaverit. So pro·
bably at the end oi Acts LIILand IV. oi the Mostellaria the stage
was leit empty, but not at the end oi Act IL-Cicero evidenti

knew only the division into three acts: cp. ad Quint. fr. 1. 1, ιζ
46 illud te ad extremum et aro et hortor, ut tanquam poetae boni
etactores industrii solent, sic ta in extrema parte et conclusione
muneris ac negotii tui diligentissimus sis, ut iric tertius annus
imperii tui tanquam tertius actus perfectissimus etarnatissimus
sutsstmlitntur. In de Seu. 19, 70 moda itt quocunque uerit actu
prabaar he seems to use actus loosely ior ‘scene’.— he justice
of the rule has been osten, and not without reason disputedz and
some of the greatest modern pla wrights, especially among the
F rench, prefer the division into tdree acts. ' '

100. mactata has certainly less authority than metanda
(especially as the old Berne MS. has exspectanda), but it seems
to be required by the sense. In Sat. 1. 10‚. 39 where putanda
is certainl right, many MSS. have spectata, but here the con-
verse condtsiou seems to have taken place. There is a tautology
in ‘to be brought iorward once more to be seen'‚ which there is
not in ‘after it has once been seen, to be brought out again’.
[Why not take reponi as ‘to be laid aside'? spectanda will then
come in 3 ita reponi ut spectanda sit: i.e. the play may still hope
for some more performauces. J. s. κ]
