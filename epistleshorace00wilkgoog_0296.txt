(Anu. v. 15 Vahl.) refers apparently only to Ennius himself.
Tertullian gives the order as Euphorbus, Pythagoras, Homer, a
peacock by a bold anachronism. Mommsen’s words ‘The re·
markable vision, with which the m (of the Annals) opens, tells

may only be adistorted expression of the satirist ς cp. Conington's
note. Conington here renders

‘nor cares how he redeems
the gorgeous promise oi his peacock dreams'.

making it interrogative, ‘Did I say that Ennius is now sure oi
his place? Why even Naevius, so much more archaic awriter,is
still always in our hands, and familiar to us, as if he were almost
one of our own time'. Naevius served in the First Punic War,
and therefore could not have been born later than about Μ. 260=
he died about Μ. 200. (Cicero Brut. 15, 60 says in Μ. 204,
but there is reason to believe that he lived at least three or four
ears longer: cp. Mommsen Hist. 11. 4 7 note.) Ennius was
born Μ. 2392 and died Μ. 16 ,so that liic. Tusc. 1. 1, gmakes
a slip in speaking oi him as ol er than Naevius, unless, as ispro·
bable, the words there used are due to an inaccurate marginal

gloss. In any case the poetryof Naevius was decidedly more ἵ

archaic than that of Ennius.
