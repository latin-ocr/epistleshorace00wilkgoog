bt). aornar the reference cannot be to the familiar iabl'e of
the crow aad the fox (Phaedr. 1. 13, Babr. urrisun), as Schiitz'
thinks: in that there is no rixa, no invidia. Horace must
either have had an inaccurate remembrance os the story, or have
been thinking of quite a different one, in which the crow by the
noise which it made over some booty which it had discovered
attracted others to claim a share in it.

52. Brundisium might be visited by the patron ior busi-
ness or on state-affairs, as by Maecenas: cp. Sat. ,1. 5, Sur·
rentum ior pleasure: it was especially famous for its mild and
salubrious climate, Stat. Silv.11. a, Sil. Ital. v. 466 Zephyro
Surrentum malle salubri. s 3„

53. salebm=asperitates itineris Acron. So used by Meri.

is a more natural accompaniment of the periscelis than the
savourite dog, and besides can be more easily replaced by the
lover’s generosity, which is to be awalrened by the complaint.

δε. rurus, chosen by the impostor as the scene oi his acci·
dent, because there would there be most passus-by.

ὅθ. piatum: a Greek word (cp. Ev. Matth. xxvii. 63
ἐκεῖνος ὁ πλάνος εἶπεν ἔτι ζῶν), used also by Cic. Cluent. 26, 7²

this instance genuine, but also bore the evident stamp oi
genuineness.
