414 ARS POETICA.

ν rantibus [a cognatisi] illorum fuisse credantur, qui efferuntur.
Hi ergo vocantur θρηνῳδοὶ] If Alexandrinis not corrupt, this
looks as ifhe knew nothing of the custom at Rome. Keller
says that there were ‘Spit'alerinnen' in Ulm till far into the
present century who ‘bowled' for pay at hvnerals

etr. dorum: Ep. 1. 18, 11. plus,m0reusual than magis
with verbs of emotion. ·

Μ regen ‘princes'‚ i. e. wealthy men, as in Sat. 1. a, 86
regibus hic moseri, Sat„ 11. a, 45 epulis regam. Still it mayhave
its usual force here.

ortulis: Keller on Carm. 1. 31, 11—the only other place
where this word is found-shows that the evidence is strongly in
favour of this form as against oeladle's: the derivation is uncer-
tain. but the word is probably alrin to cule'gnoarvltlxvvy (Fest.
p. 51), and it certainly has nothing to <lo with culleus, os Acron
says.

48⁶. tomum: Ep. 1. 13, 38. The story of Tiberius, quoted-
by Orelli, is of very doubtful applicability. muneram: v, 98.

laborent seems to beon the whole better supported than
laborant ; Bentley says ‘sane qnid modus subiunctivus hic faciat,
non video’, and most recent editors (even Keller) follow him.
But surely the relative clause is subobhque If the construction
had been ‘dicunt reges etc. ’, the subjunctive would have been
almost necessary; as it is, it is at least legitimate.

43⁶. an ‘to see whether’: in such cases an affirmative
answer is suggested: cp. Zumpt ἕ 354, v. 462. condes: Ep. 1.
3· ²4·

437. sub volpe. In Aesop’s sable of the fox and the crow.
the fox plays the part ofa crafty flatterer bent upon securing
something for himself, and so here is used for the adsentator of
v. 4roff. Itis quite needless to say, with many editors, that

ffox' is here used for ‘fox’s skin’‚ or to try to bring in the skin ¹

by bold emendations r e. g. Peerlkamp suggests fallent sud amaea

pelle latentes, Ribbeck volpes sub pelle mento, as if there were ,

several foxes in one skin! Pers v. 116 forces the note asusual,
fronte politus osteetam vopeolo servor in pectore volpem.

4³8. onmtttto: Quintilius Varus of Cremona, whose death '

in nc. ²4 Horace laments in Carm. 1. 24. where he ascribes to r

him inempta fides nudoque veritas: he is probably the Varus
of Epod. v. and Canu. 1. 18, and was also a friend of Vergil,
who insegne' concordio et familiaritate usur est Quintili Tuccoe
et Vari, but he must not be confused with Varius or with Vergil's
Alfenus Verus: alebat shows that he was dead at this time.
sodes: Ep. 1. 1, 62 (note). metune, frequentativee Roby517r6.
A S· G. ξ 7²0 (though he omits si: but cp. Kiihner 11. 5 214, ω
