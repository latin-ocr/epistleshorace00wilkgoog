τοι HORATI EP'JSTULAE.J ,

unsrun xvrrss ⁹ '

This Epistle contains advice to a certain Scaeva, as to the
eourse which should be adopted to secure and to 'profit by the
favour of the great. Nothing is known or conjectured with

probability of theman to whom it was addressed. The scholiasts ³

say that his name'was Lollius Scaeva, and that he was a Roman
knight. ,This notionis based upon the assumption that this
Epistle and the next are addressed to the same man, which is
demonstrably false. The cognomen Scaeva is found at this
period in use with the Junian and Cassian gentes, but there isno
evidence to connect Horace’s friend with either of them. Nor
isthere any indication of its date, unless indeed we may assume
that in writing v. 33 Horace had in his mind the triumph of
Augustus in Β. c. 29. But in any case the Epistle must have becu
written after that date. Some critics have found grievous fault
with the tone which Horace here adopts. But it does not come
to much more than this, that a cynic’s life is not necessarily the
best, and that modesty is the best policy: no very degrading
doctrine, if not ideally elevated.

2. tandem: Horkel’s conjecture tenuem is very ingenious,
and has been actually adopted by Meineke: but it is not neces·
sary. No parallel seems to have been adduced for the use of
tardem in dependent-questions τ but there is no reason why it
should not bc retained from the 'direct interrogation3 and
although it usually denotes some slight impatience on the part of
the speaker, this is often so slight as to be hardly perceptible. γ

be quite superfluous, if referred to Scaeva The diminutive has
the force of ‘ your humble friend ’.
