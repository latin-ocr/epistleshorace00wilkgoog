8⁶, dscldlt ‘has dropped off’ like falling leaves: cp. Plaut.
Trin. 544 solstitiali morbo detritum.

⁸8. flnls ‘limit’, not, as Acron says, definition.

42. uapor, the reading of the best MSS., is at the same
time, as Bentley showed, the only tense which will snit both
praesens and postero. Earlier editions had either respuit or
respuet. In the preceding line Bentley proposed to replace
poetas· by probosque, a suggestion which certainly improves the

‘concinnity’ of the passage, but is not needsul. For the rhyming
of the two lines poetas...aetas, which was one of his objections to
the reading of the MSS., cp. A Ρ. 99-100, lyd-73 Verg.
Aen. 1. 319·3ao, 625-63 111. 656-7: Gossran (App. deHexometro
Wrgilr'i) quotes eleven more instances from the Aeneid. Most
of these seem to be purely occidental, like those in Horace: but
in the more archaic poets there are traces of an intentional use of
rhyme (cp. Ennius in Cic. Tusc. 1. 35, 85) and in a later age .
Eustathius expresses his admiration of Hom. 11. xxu. 383·4.

43. honeste ‘with honour’, i-e. he will not disgraee those
among whom heis ranked.

46. caudae ullos: it is possible that there is a reference here
(as the editors generally suppose} to the story told by Plutarch
of Sertorius, how “when he had called all his army together, he
caused two horses to be brought into the field, one an old feeble
lean animal, the other a lusty, strong horse, with a remarkably
thick and long tail. Near the lean one he placed a tall strong
man, and near the strong young horse a weak despicable looking
lellow: and at a sign given, the strong man took hold of the
weak horse’s tail with both his hands, and drew it to him with
his whole force, as ii he would ull it off ; the other, the weak
man, in the mean time set to worii to pluck off hair by hair from
the great horse's tail: the former os course effected nothing, while
the latter had soon removed the whole tail: whereupon Sertorius
said: ‘You see, fellowsoldiers, that perseverance is more prevail·
ing than violence, and that many things, which cannot be
overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when
taken little by little”' (Clough's Plutarch, 111. 400). But as
Horace is not teaching‘a moral lesson here, but simply illustra-
ting a logical process, l see very little reason to suppose that this
story was in his mind at all. The hairs in a tail may very well
have been a current example in the schools, like the grains in a
heap. lhe fallacy of the φάλακρος invented by Eubulides isa
somewhat similar instance.

46. etlam seems to be supported by the majority os good
MSS., and is strongly comfinned hythe imitation in Pers. vl. 58
