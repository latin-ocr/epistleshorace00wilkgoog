8. Thraca, a poetical form (εθρᾴκη) used also Ep. 1. 16, ¹3
aad by Verg. Aen. xil. 335. Ribbeck and Kennedy there read
straete, and Keller here with one MS. has T lireca: the latter
cannot well be right. Cp. Fleckeisen Fe'e'nsar'g Artikel, p. 30.
Servius on Verg. l. c. says that Cicero used Thracam in the de
Rep„ but the MS. (11. 4, 9) has the later form Thraciam: cp.
Lachmann on Lucr. v. 30, Ellis on„ Catullus, iv. 8. In the Odes
(11. 16, 5, 111. 25, rr) Horace according to his custorn uses the
Greek form Thrace, so does Ovid, F ast. v. 257, Pont. 1v. 5, 5.

Hebrus, proverbially cold: Carm. 1. 25, 203 Ep. 1. 16, 13.
Dr Schmitz in Dict. Geogr. says it is still sometimes irozen over.
The snowotien lies thick on the Baikans in winter, but 1 can find
no other modern authority for the ireezing os the Hebrus any

Munro quotes Shakspere's Othello 111. 3, ‘like to tlte Pontia sea,
whose icy current and compulsive course ne’er feels retiring ebb,
bur keeps due on to tlte Propontie and tlte Hellespont? tumes oi
Sestos and Abydos. The tower of Hero at Sestos is often
’ mentioned, and Strabo xm. aa, speaks oi πύργον rad κατ’
ἀντικρὺ τῆς Σηστοῦ, (in Lucan lx. 955 Heroas lacrimoso liare
turres, the plural seems to be merely a poetical variatim), but
we need not seek for authority ior so natural a phrase. Bentley
adopts terras from the Bland. vet: this seems to be one of the
numerous instances in which that MS. bears the markos an
ingenious critical recension, rather thau a genuine tradition.
Cp. Introd.
