1⁰6. landum cp. MrJustice’Lawson’s words in the Anti,-
ἷῖανξαη Magaaine for June 1883, p. 289: ‘The river Licenaa,

orace’s Digentia, flows through the bottom of the valleylfar
beneath us [at Vico Var0]‚ alimpid stream, speedingto jein the
Anio. On the opposite side of the river, situate upon a loft
eminence, isa village now called Cantclupo Bardella, whicf
is Horace's Mandela, described byvhim as ‘rugosus frigore
Ξὲῗὲ tltttnttsg‘yntltt ilnlyn‘hltitflnn
down the hill to draw their supplies of water from »the Digentia
flowing at its base’. κ

107. ui nnn vivam: the old reading was ut, which Keller
defends, accepting the interpretation of Porphyrion, ‘provided
that ’. Bentley rejected this, partly because ‘omnes libri paullo
vetustiores’ have et, partly because he doubted this use of ut,
when not followed by tamen, and almost all recent editors have
followed him. But the clear preponderance of the best MSs. is

in‘favour of ut (unless we attach overwhelming weight to the ·

’ vet. Biana), aud 1 cannot but think that internal evidence as
strongly supports it. Mihi is emphatic: ‘for myself’, and not
for the vain demands of frivolous society. h Reading et, we must
‘take the two wishes as independent: ‘May I have as much as I
now have or even less, and may I live to myself, for all of life
‘that yet remains', if it is the will of the gods that 'aught- should
yet remain’. Is it good sense for a manto wish to have what
he now has, or even less, without adding the conditions on which
heis willing to be content with less—in 'Horace's case the re·
tention of his independence? As teche usage of ut. how does
this passage differ from Cic. ad 'Fami Ix. 6, 4 libenter omnibus
onrnis opes coaccesserim, ut (=if only) milri licedf vi nulla inter-
pellante isto modo vivere: or from Tusc. 11. 6. 16 quam turpi-
tudinem non pertulerit ut (=if only) effugiat dolorem? Mr Reid
thinks that the fact that Horace corrects himself in vv. ιιι-ιη,
and says he ought to ask the gods only for externa} things, and
to guarantee himself that he will deal withfthem aright, shows
that he had previously prayed forsa right frameof mind. ·But

this he does 1n v. 110.
