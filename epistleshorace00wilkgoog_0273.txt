and Alcaeus, and no one accuses them ol plagiarism, sor their
themes and style are altogether different: and so are mine.
Bentley inune of his most convincing notes first brought out
clearly the connexion and interpretation of this passage, which
had very commonly been misunderstood. Even now Ritter sup·

es that Horace draws a distinction between his Epodes and

22. οῐᾱωο, best understood with' Bentley ol the arrangement
of the various lines used by Archilochus in a strophe: eg. the
Archilochus minor (arboribusque comae) was coupled by Alcaeus
with a dactylic hexameter tHor. od. lv. y), by Archilochus him·
sels with an iambic trimeter (F rag. 104).

vso, noo-quaust. The difference between Alcaeus, at any

{We can discover also ‘the same enjoyment ol fove and wine, of
