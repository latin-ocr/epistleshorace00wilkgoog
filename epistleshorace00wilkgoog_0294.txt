tr. aras elusus ‘soiled and overthrown’, a metaphor from
a gladiator. ruentis acervi ‘the diminishing beap’, in Greek
empetros ‘quam si necesse sit, Latino verbo liceat acervalem
appellare’ (Cic. de Div. 11. 4, rr). The nature of it is explained

definition in the dictionaries based on F reund ‘a sophism
formed by accumulation’ does not really suit either. Some
editors say that the argument which proceeded by way oi addi-
tion was called the struens acopos, that which' went on gradually
diminishing was called the niens acervus. I cannot discover the
authority ior this statement.

48. remi tn natae ‘goes back npon the annals’.

44. moram: an ancient Italian goddess, originally of gardam
andos pleasure generally, called also Lubentirra (from lubet, lu· ’
bido, etc). Afterwards she cameto be regarded as the goddess·
of hadal, by a transition strange to us, but not unexampledin r
