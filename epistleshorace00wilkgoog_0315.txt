Pope’s imitation · ·

‘Even copious Dryden wanted or forgot ’ “ ’
The last and greatest⁴ art, 'the art to blot‘.

We may remember also, in Ben Jonson's Discenenea the criticism
on Shaksperez “l remember the players often mentioned it as
an honour to S. mat in his writings‚ whatsoever he penned, he
never blotted out a tine. My answer hath been, ‘Would he
had blotted out a thousand’.”

168. ex medlo ‘from daily life ’.

arcem: some of the best MSS. here have accersit. For
a discussion of the relation of the two forms or words cp.
Journal of Perlonge VI. 278 ff. The vet. Bland. has accessit;
but it is clearly better to take res as acc. plur. rather than nom.
sing.t the perfect tense is out ol place3 and if cesis the subject
of accessit, it must also be taken as the subject of creditunin·
stead of comoedia,· but the latter gives a much more satisfactory

sense.

1⁸1⁰. veniae ‘indulgence' ε even uneducated spectators can
see the absurdities of unnatnral comedies.

171. quo pano ‘in whata fashion’. Is this intended for
blame or praise? Editors are divided in their judgment. Acron
leaves the ambignity: Porph. has quam indecenter, incongrue:
and so Conington renders

‘What ill-sustained affairs*
Are his close fathers and his love-sich heirsi'

Lambinus on the other hand argued that as Horace in A. P. 270 ff.
blames his rough metre and coarse wit, there would be little left,
if he did not allow him even the credit of vigorous character-
'ntingz and Schiitz points out that in critieizing Roman tragedy

orace first recognizesmerit, then addsblame, and that theblame
in the case of Plautus comes in clearly in v. 174. But Horace is
here pointing out that comedy, though thought to be easy, is
really difficult, and it is not unnatural that he should at once give
prooss of his position. That the criticism is hardly warranted‚
and that Plautus really shows much power in his vivid sketches
of character, is not reason enough for us to reject an interpreta-
tion which would show that Horace judged a popular favourite
too severely. Hence the expression ‘Inok at the way in which
Plautus sustains‚ &c’ may fairly be regarded as implying
censure.
