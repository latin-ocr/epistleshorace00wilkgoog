xvi INTRODUCTION

Oi the individual ·epistles, Epi. 13 was evidently
contemporaneous with the publication of Odes i.-iii.
Of the others all those whose date* can be assigned
with any certainty, appear to belong to iac. 20. But
it is probable that Horace¹ was engaged with this style
ol' composition more or' less at various times during
the‘five years rac· 24'7-20, that is to say from 'the
fortieth to the sortyfifth year of his age

The conclusions to which we are thus brought are
practically the same as those maintained by Franke,
and supported by the weighty approval of Lachmann.
Bentley in h'is preface assigned a slightly later date,
and needlessly limited the time os composition to two
years (rac 20-219); Ritter holding that Odes i-iii.
were published in uc, 19 is compelled to postpone
the publication of the first Boolr os the Epistles to
Bc· 18. ⁵

The time of the publication os the Second Book
and of the ΑΛ· Portica is open to more doubt.
But the dates of composition, which on the whole
seem most probable, are sor Ep. ii.v '1 about rac. 13,
for Ep. ii. a about rac. 19, and sor the Ars Poetr'ca,
rae. 20 or 194 The reasons which lead us to these
conclusions will be sound in the Introductions to
the several Epistles. If they are sound‚ Book 11.
was publishedin rac. 13, and the Ars may have
been issued' earlier and separately.

ι The view, which till recently has been the most

generally accepted, assigns Ep. ii. r, a to a period ,
