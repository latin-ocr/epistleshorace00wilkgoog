sornewhat weak, and could well be spared, or transferred to
aster 155, as Peerlkamp suggests; but we have seen frequently
that a certain tone oi negligence was intentionally preserved by
Horace in this epistle.

tra plausorts: Bentley attacked this reading oi the MSS.
and scholiasts, ou the ground that it would be intolerable with
plaudite so soon following. But his suggestion scrutaris is no

the Mss. But plausor need not be limited to a pald claqneur,
as Schiitz seems to think; it may denote one who persistently
applauds (Ep. 11. a, 13ol: and applause was uot confined to
the end oi the play, as we see from many references in Cicero.

leo. cantor: in the best MSS. oi the Trinummus oi
Plautus and os all the plays of Terence, the characters are
denoted not by initial letters, but by Greek capitals‚ and when
the sarne actor took two parts, the same letter was prefixed to
each (Ritschl, Praei. Trin. p. lv.). To the word plaudite, with
which a Latin comedy always closes, is prefixed ω. Bentley

other Greek letters (cp. Ritschl, Proll. Trin. p. xxa). Now the
word cantor may take one ot' two meanings, whence much eou-
iusion has crept into our authorities: lor canere is used both oi
playiug on the huie, and oi singing with the voice. In a
Roman play, as Ritschi first clearly shewed, there were three
kinds oi delivery‚ (r) recitation‚ (a) recitative, and (3) lyric
song. The first was properio iambie diverbia, unaccompanied
by the flute: the second to iambic or trochaic septenarians,
accompanied by the flute (aud included iu the term cantica)
