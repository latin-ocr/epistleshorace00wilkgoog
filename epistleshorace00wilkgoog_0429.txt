strengthen the sonnd of the voice, although it seems to have had
this effect: but neither was it invented by the Romans, so the
argument drawn from this falls to the ground. It was undoubt-
edly introduced by Thespis to enable the recitet to assume
different parts. Horace here ascribes 'to Aeschylus inventions
which must have been made long before his time, probably in
consequence of his reputation as an improver of sceuic properties
generally. Cp· Suidas: Αἰσχύλος ἐὗρε προσωπεῖα δεινὰ καὶ χρώμασι

first used (according to Donatus) by Minucius Prothymus about
tac, rao—100. Others say that Roscius first used it. Ribbeck
(Rom. T rag. p. 661) suggests that Minucius may have been the
director of the troupe in which Roscius acted. As the orchestra
was seated for spectators at Rome, they were brought much
nearer to the actors than in Greece, and the innovation was dis·
liked (eie, de Orat 111. 59, aar sencs..personotum ne Roscium
quidem magno opere laudabant), although the fire in the actor’s
eyes was still visible (ib, 11. 46, 193). Aesopus seems to have
acted, at least sometimes, without a mask (Cic. de Div. 1. 37, 80
moi‚..in Aesopo tantum ardorem vultuum atque ntotuum, etc).
