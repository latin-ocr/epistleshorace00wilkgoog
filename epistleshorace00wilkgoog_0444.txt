our MSS.; hence paulum is rightly retained by Munro‚ eg.
1411, in spite of Lachmann on 111. 1114. Augustus wrote
paulo in the Meu. Aucyr. 111. 11, and so the MSS. have in
Verg. Ect 1v. 1. On the other hand Paullus is the form ot*
the roper name on coins and inscriptions, though MSS. are
dividet. Cp. Sat. 1. 6, 41. The word is not directly connected
with paucies (as Roby‚ ἕ 868, says) but is more probably ior
paurulus. Cp. Corssen 11² 331-1.

ὃ verrit od imum, ‘approaches the lowest': 11. is little better
than the worst.

λ· dli. 11111111, not, as Orelli, such as are mentioned in the
next line, but ‘weapons’ sor sham fights: cp. Ep. 1. 18, 54.

ΛΛ 880. ntus: indoctus nowhere else issollowed by the gen.
but cp. sollers lyrae in v. 407, Roby§ 13111, 3. G. ἓ 316. Cp.
Sat. 11. 1, 11 seu pila velox...seu te discus ogis. For the various
kinds of hall-play cp. Marquardn Rom. Pmuatalt. 11. 410-415,
or Primer of Rom. Ant. p. 37. The ball and quoit were held
in high esteem, but the hoop (trochus) was rather despised:
cp. Carm. 111. 14, 57, Ov. Trist. 11. 486,111. 11,11,Α11. Am.
111. 383 sunt illis (sc. uiris) celeresque pilae iaculumque trochique .

agri modum centauream te audisset servos suos esse censum. Roby
8 1117 says this 'ns the only other instance oi this construction of
censeor. Geil. vn. 13, 1 has clasu'ci dt'cebautur, qui cxxv. milia
aeris ampliusue censi erant, but this is later than Roby’s limits.
The construction with abl. is m'ore common, and from this use
comes the very frequent meaning in later writers ‘to be valued or
distinguished for': eg. Mart. 1. 61, 3 cernetur Apono Livio seeo
tellus: the accusative construction seems to have given rise to the
curious use in Ovid, Ep. Pont. 1. 1, ¹37 hane...dileetam estruter
comites Marciacum ruas. For the equestrian census cp. Ep.
