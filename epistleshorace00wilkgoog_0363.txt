as it was earlier called, liesto the south-east of the Lesser Syrtis,
-The Lotophagi were said to have lived there: but it was not
near ffle territory occupied in historic times by the Gaetuliam,
who extended to the sea only to the S.W. of Mauretania. (At
‘the same time we may notice that Juvenal xltt. 278-9 laces
the Gaetula aequora to the east of Calpe, and that Strabo xvn.
p. 3²9) makes the Gaetulians extend usfar as the Syrtes.) It
was here mainly that the purple fish was found (Plin. v. r, ra

the subj. But if Horace had meant, as most editors say ‘the
wise man', could he have used the indicative? Orelli’s ex-
planation ‘quia certum est, indicativo utitur, cum illud sunt qui
non habeanta casu tantum pendeat ’, is not satisfactory. The
poet rather denotes himself: ‘I know une at least who does
not care to have'. So Conington rightly takes it, and
