174 Ι aanor] EPISTULAE.

EPISTLE XIV.

This letter, though nominally addressed to Horace's farm-¹
bailiif, may be regarded as really an apology for his love for the
country, intended for his friends at Rome. lt thus takes up the
theme of Ep. x. and of the earlier part of Ep. vn„ while it is
the reverse of Sat. 11. 7. Whether the bailiff deserved all the
‚hard things here said of him is a question which has been asked,
but cannot be answered. Horace may have been intending to
give an example of the class of baihffs, against whom Columella
utters his warning (1. 8, 1): praemoneo ne uilicum ex eo genere.
seruorum, qui corpore placuerunt, instituamus: ne ex eo qualem

ordine, qui urbanas ae delicatas artes exercuerit. Socors et sonni- 2

culorum genus id mancipiorum, oties, campis, circo, theatris, aleae,
popinae, lupanaribus consuetum, nunquam non easdem ineptias
somniat (quoted by Orelli). There is no indication of the date.

dul-b. Corne, bailiff, let us see whether you· or I best do our
e y.

1. vffloe: the form invariably found in good MSS. and in·
scriptions. Lachmann on Lucret. 1. 33¹ showed that l not ll

was used between a long i and a short one a so mille, but ηιίίιὶι, l

oilla, but vilicus: cp. Roby§ 177. The vilnus was the head
slave on a farm, whose duty it was to look after the proper dis·
charge of all farm works: Cato de Re Rust. exul. uilici efficia
quae sunt, quae dominus praecepit, ea omnia quae in fundo fieri
oportet, quaeque erni pararique oportet, eadem uti curet faciatque
moneo, dominoque dicto audiens sit. Cato gives iu c. 11. a very
amusing account of the way in which a good economist will call

unvanus toastrict account for any neglect or deficiency. ³

mtht me reddentis, ‘that makes me my own master agaim,
ie. where 1 can live as 1 please, without being distracted by the
endless claims made upon me at Rome. Cp. Sat. 11. 6, 23—39,
ooff. The woods on Horace’s Sabine estate are mentioned 1n

Carm. 111. 16, 29 silvaque iugerum pancorum, and iu Ep. 1. . ,

16, 9.
a maerensmaerens, ‘though rt emisses a ieme

for five families’. Horace in Sat. 11. 7, 118 speaks of his 1

familia rustica us consisting of eight operae i‘hands’). Hence
Ritter presses the force of the past participle, thinking the meen-
ing to be that whereas five free coloni formerly worked the estate,
now eight slaves tilled it. But the lack of a present participle
passive in Latin often leads to the use of the perfect rticiple,
where a present would have been more natural (eg. iv. xxx.
