128 HORA TI EPISTULAE*

on Lucret. 1v. 1022 (where he similarly reads extumntur for
extenuetur, ‘are scared'), Haupt, etc. The word is found
twice iu Catullus (Lx1v. 71, 165) and three times in Ovid
(Met. 1. 641, Χῖ. 77, Ibis 432) in just the sense here required,
and therefore is not ‘unclassical' as Keller says But exterret
may be defended by Verg. Aen. xr. 806 fuget ante omaus exter·
ritus Arruns laetitr'a mentoque metu (ep. G. 111. 434), Luor. 11.
1040 novitate exterritus ipsa

12. gaudeat, etc.‚ ‘whether he rejoices’, etc.‚ not as Keller
takes it, with a colon at metuatne, the jussive subjunctive. ‘This
classification of the emotions under four heads originated with'the
Stoics, but in Horace's time had become a eommonplace. Cp.
Verg. Aen. VI. 733 hinc metuunt cupiuntque, dolmt gaudentque,
quoted by Augustine de Civ. D. xw. 3 as a Stoic echo. Cp.
Plat.1{'haed.8313 ἡδονῶν καὶ ἐπιθυμιῶν καὶ λυπῶν rol φόβων)

1³. spo, ‘expectation’, with the ambiguous meaning shown
also in pavor and exterret. This is more common with the verb
spero (cp. Verg. Aen. 1. 543, 11. 658, etc-l than with the sub·
stantive3 but cp. Sall. Jug. Lxxxvm. r contra spem suam lae·
tissimis animis excipitur, Cat. XX. 13 analo res¹ spes mutto
asperior with Kritz's note.

14. defixis oculis, ‘You stare, look blank, grou numb from
top to toe’. Con.

16. ultra quam saur est. There is no reason to suppose
(with Macleane) that Horace is speaking either ironically or
‘with an unusual fit of enthusiasm'. The need of moderatiori in
pursuit even of virtue is a commonplace with philosophers: cp.
Cic. pro Mur. 30, 63 nostri itti a Platone et Aristotele, marran·
homines et temperati aiunt...0mnes virtutes mediocn'tate quadam
esse temperatas, Cic. Tusc. tv. 25, 55 studea vel mimarum rerum
sedata tamen et tranquilla esse debent. ib. 1v. 29, 66 etrum si vir·

tutis vehementior appetetur sit, eadem est omnibus ad deterrendum
adhibenda orabit.

tv-t‘t. Set your beart on tlte treasures os art, on fame and
on ecculm, ts you wilt.- but remember tltat you will soon have to

abandon all. »

17. 1 nuno, ‘go now’‚ an ironical imperative to do something
which under the circumstances is impossible. or at least not to be
expected, usually followed by et, as in Ep. 11. 6, 76. ep. Pers.
1v. 19 i nunc...sufla‚ where Jahn remarks ‘irridentis vel expror
brantis formula'‚ and gives many other examples. ,

utentum, here ‘plate', as in Sat. 1. 4, 68, Juv. t. 76, etc.; not
‘money’. artis, ‘works of art', cp. earm. rv. ι8, 5 divitem
