222. HORATI EPISTULAE.

, 80. ιιΗοπόι. Ii you have been deceived aud have iutro·
duced a man who proves unworthy, do notattempt to stand by
him, in order that you may not exhaust your influence, but may
preserve it unimpaired for the protection of one whom you know
well, and who looks to you sor help, when assailed by calumny.
Bentley's conjectures ae and fidenter are quite superfluous.

82. dente maome: the scholiasts tell us that Theon wasa
very witty and abusive freedman, who so offended his patron by
his bitter jests that he was turned out othis house, and hade
*ianhiug leit to him that he might buy a ropefland hang himself.
Nothing further rs known of hun, aud even thus rs not very trust·

circummittit: cp. Sat. 1. 4, 81 absentem qui rodit anticum.
’ amatunam ‘do you feel at alli’ ie. ‘don't you feeli'

88-95. Itr'saiard task to retain ihc fravaur of tite pomersul, l

ἡ 87. metuet is perhaps a little hetter supported than marcii.

Ter. And. 186, 415. =

91. The spuriousness of this line does not admit of a ques·
tion. It is not found iu an of the good MSS.. aud contains two
inexplicable difficulties: (ribibulipotores is, as Bentley saw, little
better than potantes potores, while to connect bibuli with Falerni
is to do reckless violence to the meaning of the word: (a) media
de nocte could only mean ‘as early as midnight’: cp. Ep. 1. a,
323 14, 34. Itis evident that‘some copyist (not besore the xith
century) feeling the need of a subject to oderunt introduced
potores and then attempted to make up the line by a clumsy
adaptation of Ep. 1. 14, 34 quem bibulum liquidi media de lnce
Falerni. The subject to oder-unt may be derived from porrecta
pocula, i.e. porrigentes pocula. It unquestionably makes'a neater
line to retain potores and omit oderunt, as is done by Meiueke,
Haupt, L. Miiller, Kriiger and Schiitz. But I cannot see how
we can be· justified in rejecting a word which is found in all
our good MSS. and retaining one which ap ars first in the
inferior ones. How are we to conceive of ehistory oi the
line, if the true reading peloris was ousted for centuries by ode·
runt, and theu suddenly reappeared‚ bringing with it a spurious
ending to the line? lt is quite astounding to find Macleane say·
