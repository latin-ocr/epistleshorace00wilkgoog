2⁸· Many MSS. and some old editions begin a new epistle
here, failing to notice the connexion between this sketch of
Maenius the glutton, and Horace’s humorous expression of his
intention to live on the best fare that he can get. For the rapid
transition cp. Ep. 1. 7, 14, and46.

Euentus-achamom attached also by Lucilius, ancl mentioned

in Sat. 1. 3, 2'1, perhaps also in Sat. 1. 1, 101 (but cp. Ritter ad
loo). Porphyrion says ‘qni de personis Horatianis scripserunt,
aiunt Maenium scurrilitate notissimum Romae’. He was said
to have prayed aloud in the Capitol on the Kalends of January
that he might owe 4oo,ooo sesterces, explaining his prayer to
one who asked him the meaning of it, by saying that he owed
at the time 800,ooo. Some have supposed, but without good
grounds, that he was the Pantolabus of Sat. 1. 8, 11.

‚urbanus (Ep. 1. 9, 11) is best connected with ma, as in
Plaut. Most. 15 tu urbanus vero scurra, damae popli, rus miti
tu abactas? From Plaut Trin. aon urbani assidui cinei, quos
scurras vocant, we see that scm had aot quite the same sense ²
as in Horace, but meant rather ‘lounger', ‘gossip ’. In Catull.
xxlr. a the mats equals the scurra oi v. 1a, a ‘wit ’, quite
in a good sense, a meaning which is found even'in Cicero (pro
Quinct 3. 11 nom neque parum facetus scurra Sex. Naeviar
neque inhumanus protco cst unquam extitimus), although from
de Orat 11. 60, 247 it appears that the bad sense was beginning
to be predominant. Hor. Sat. 1. 5, 5² shows the change
complete 3 scurra :perustus ‘springer'.

’ 28. mesella ‘crib’‚ cp. Plaut. Cure. aar tormento non

29. inpransus, le. if he had had no meal that day: the
prandium was the first substantia] meal of the day, usually talren

atmidday.
