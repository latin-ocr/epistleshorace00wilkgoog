¹ ‘lunacy'z foeneranda illm is an explanatory addition, not, as

Schiitz thinks, a different kind oi disorder. Acron here has
‘fanaticum errorem pati (licuntur, qui a fanis percutiuntur, id,
est qui· lymphatico agitantur. Sicut lunaticum aut morbosum,
ita insanum poetam tugiunt sapientes’. This use of the word
lunaticus is not common before the Vulgate. Diana, though not
strictly the same as Luna, was often identified with her, as by

Homer's μακρὸν ἄασεν, Il. 111. 81.

,, 460. non nit, not imperative¹ as Kriiger and others (cp. Sat.
