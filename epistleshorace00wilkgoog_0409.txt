natural one. The transposition (hyperbaton) of ·que is common
enough in Horace, eg. Sat. 1. 6, 44 cornua q‘nbdqvineatque tubas,

morari may well be used sor ‘to dwell with care upon ¹. Hence

it is so awkward to supply sempter, that we must regard thus

’ teudingus simply an oversight, perhaps due ιο agitur.
