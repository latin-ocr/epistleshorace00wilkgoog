liasts say that Antimachus, in relating the 'return ol Diomede,
began with the history os Meleager, the brother of his father,
TydeuS, and filled twenty-four books before he even got as far
as the campaign of the Seven against Thebes, in which Tydeus
fell. But as the Thebais of Antimachus-a poem, which though
not generally popular, won for its writer in the judgment of
some critica a place next to Homer (cp. Quintil. x. 1, 53 with
Mayor's notel-can barely have touched upon the return of
Diomede from the Trojan War, there is probably some error in
the tradition. Welcker Ep. Cyclus p. 1ο3 supposes the refer·
enee here to be to the-return ol Diomede to Aetolia alter the
campaign oi the Epigoni against Thebes. ,But it is hardly pos·
sible to understand the ‘reditus D.’ ol anything but his more
famous return from Troy (cp. Verg. Aen. v111. 9, XI. 226 eto).
Hence it is better to suppose that there is no reference to Anti·
machus or his Thebais at all, but to some Cyclic poem, now
unknown, belonging to the legendary cycle ol the Noorol.

14¹1. gemino—ab ovo, ie. from the birth of Helen. Servius
on Verg. 111. 338 says Ledam Iuppiter iu cygnum mutolur grovi-
dam fecit, quoe ouum pepem'sse dieitur, uncle nati wuillelmo,
Castor et Pollux. Horace here follows another form ol the story,
according to which Castor and Pollux were born from one egg
(cp. Sat. 11. r, 26 ovo prognatus eodem), Helen from another. lt
is possible that gemino ovo means ‘the two eggs': cp. Cic. p. Sest.

111 medias res: as in Odyss. 1. rr ἔνθ’ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι
φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον οἴκοι ἔσαν etc. So the Iliad be ins witha
scene in the tenth year of the siege ; and Vergil plunges into
the midst ol his narrative (Aen. 1. 34) with the words: vair ι

‚ corrspeclu Siculae telluris iu altrum velo dobant laeti etc. Prot

Nettleship (Vergil aud leis Ancieut Critics in Conington’s
Vergil 1.⁴ p. xxxvi.) happily suggests that this passage in Horace
is intended as a desence ol Vergil against contemporary obtrec-
tatores ‘nescientes hanc esse artem poeticam, ut a mediis inci·
pientes per narrationem prima reddamus' (Servius on Aen. p. 4
Thilo). Cp.v Cic. ad Art. 1. 16, 1 respondebo rili ὕστερον
