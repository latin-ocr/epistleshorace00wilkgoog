legitimate to take quoque as the ablative of quisque, although the
expression is not to be explained with Orelli and others as for
quid de quocunque-homine dicos: rather it implies thatin each
individual case care is to be used. Cp. Madvig’s De Finibus,
Excursus vr. p. 836 note.

71. omissum ‘let slip’: A. Ρ. 390 nescit vox missa reuerti.
I doubt whether the generally assumedreferouce to an arrow
allows sufficiently for the idea of carelessness here involved. Cp.
Menander Frag. 607 Mein. οὔτ’ ἐκ χερὸς μεθέντα καρτερᾶς (sic
Cobet) λίθον door κατασχεῖν, οὔτ’ ἀπὸ γλώσσης λόγον.

. 72. non-ullo, to be talren closely together=nulla. For
the question of non with imperatives cp. J. E. Nixon in the
,Joomm of Ptrtology v11. 54—59: Palmer on Sar. 11. 5, 91:
Dreiger Hist. Sym. 1. 286.

iocur: frequently regarded as the seat of the emotions: cp.

Carm. 1. 13, '4 meum feruens dzfficilt' bile tunut iecur, ib. 25, 15
iecur ulcerosum, Sat. 1. 9, 66 meum iecur urere bilis. Ἴ

76. beot out—angui: if the patron grants your request, he
will think that he has discharged all obligations, though his gift
is really of little value: if he is churlish and refuses you, this will
cause you¹ pain. There was a story to the effect that Vergil

, received from, Maecenas a favourite slave named Alexander, and

from Pollio another named Cebes. Cp. Ribbeck Narr. p. xxxi.

78. quondam ‘at times:’ op. Carm.11. ιο, 18 quondam
cithara tacentem suscitat Musam: Sat. 11. a, 82 hie tantm od
melius poterit transcurrere quomdam, Verg. Aen. 11. 367 quondam
etiam m'ctis redit im praecordia virtus: cp. vl. 877. In Cic. ad
Fam. 11. 16, ν quoted by L. and S. for this meaning of quondam,
we must certainly render ‘of old’: in de Div. 1. 43, 98 quid
cum saepe lapidum, songacinis mom nunquam, terrae interdum,
quondam etiam laeter imber defluxit the climax not less plainly
points to ‘once’ as the meaning. Hence it is doubtful whether
this usage is found in Cicero. Cp. the similar use of olim.

nantinus ‘introduce'. Ep. 1. 9, 3.

79. mmet: ‘crushes ’, with a stronger force than in Ep. 1.
19, 362 so often in Tacitus: cp. Boetticher Lex. T ac. s. v.
