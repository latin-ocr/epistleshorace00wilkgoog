the traditional explanation Cp. Roby Vol. ι. pp. ‘385' 384.
Mr Palmer suggests that the meaning may be ‘grey in iront’‚
comparing ἀπὸ κροτάφων πελόμεσθα πάντες γηραλέα. Horace
speaks in Carm. 11. 11, 14 ol himself and Hirpinus as rosa canos
odaati capillos: the date of this ode cannot be fixed precisely,
but it was written at latest three or four years belore this epistle.
In nc. ²4 (Carm- ιιι. 14, 25) he isalbcscens.

mutas aptum ‘lond oi sunning mysell'. This is the
reading oi all MSS. and ol the scholiasts, and may, Ithink‚ be
defended. Keller quotes Ov. Met. 111. 596 portus pupibus
aptos, which is not very similarsnor is Lucret. vr. 9 1 buc
acceia uti non omnia quae aduratur corpora cumque ab rebus,
adem praedita seusu atquo eodem parta rebus sint omnibus apta,
which he regards as completely analogum, sor apta is there
‘adapted to affect’ rather than ‘fitted to enjoy'. Sat. 11. 5, 45
aptus amoos is reallya closer parallel; so is Sat. 1. 3, 29 aptus
autu naribus ‘fitted to meet’: the word is rather a favourite
one with Horace, occurring 14 times. Cp.Juv.v11. 58 cupidus
silvarum aptusque bibendossontibus Aorridam. hlr Reid corn

way of saying that the sun was suited to Horace’s constitution,
a case ol hypallage in sact; so Met. 1. 681 aptam pastoribus
umbram. But lew-passages in Horace have given occasion sor
ruore numerous attempts at emendation, for the most part very
inseneitous. Kriiger (Anhang p. 375—6) mentions seven such
attempts (besides Herbst’s solibus ustum, which he himsell
adopts), and Schiitz adds one more, sollicitatum (l). It seems to
me that there are more serious objections against one and all
ol the proposed readings than against the text of the MSS.

For the practice ol sunning oue’s sels (apricatio) cp. Plin. Ep.
111. 5, ιο (of the elder Pliny) aestate, siquid otii, rooebat in
sole...past solem plerumque frigida lavabatur. ib. νι. 16, 5

to. irasci celerem: Horace's quick temper rnay possibly
be referred to in Carm. 111. 9, ιι improbo iracundior Hadria,·
and more directly in Sat. 11. 7, 35. It is exaggerated iu Sat.
11. 3, 323 non dico horrendam rabiem.

· at. Decembres: Suetonius gives the date of Horace’s birth
as sexto idus Decembris. The year of his birth is fixed by Cann.
ιιι. 21, ronuta mecum canule diaulia, and by Epod. 13‚6

vhich Suetonius also gives.
