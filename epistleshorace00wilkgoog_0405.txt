near the flute-player, to sing the cantica, while the actor accom-
panied himwithappropriategestures.—NowBentleyassumedthat
the cantor was the bute-player, and that ‘cantoris erat depositis
ex ore tibiis plaudite insonare’. Hermann on the other hand
Opusc. 1. 302) argues that the cantor and the teutria were one
and the same, quoting Cic. de Sen. 19, 70 nequeenim histrioni,
ut placeat, peragenda sabula est, utodo iu quocumque suerit actu
probetur ,· neque sapientibus euque ad ‘plaudite’ venzendum est: and
Quintil. vt. 1, 52 tuuc est commovendum theatrum cum uentum
est ad ejosum illud, qua ueteres tragoediae comoediaeque cluduntur,
pladite. The passage in Cic. only means that a good actor
need not be vexed, if he basto leave the stage before applause
is iormally challenged, by himself or some one else: the
passage in Quintil. says, nothing on the present point. 1
believe that the cautor was neither the dure-player, nor an
ordinary actor, but the singer to whom the cantica had been
committed throughout The usual books of relerence are not
clear on this point. That carator may mean ‘actor' simply has ’
been argued from Cic. p. Sest. 55, 118 ream eum ageretur togata,
caterua tota clarissima couemtatione in are impuri hominis
imurineus contionata est...Sedebat exanimatus ,· et r's, qui autea
cautorum conuicio coutimur- celebrare suas solebat, cautorum ip·
‡ sarum vocibus ridebatur. On this passage Mommsen, Ro‘m.
Gesch. 111. 307, aster speaking of the professioual demagogues‚
and their paid applaudens, go'es on to say: ‘the well-trained
throats (Gurgeln) of the staff of the theatres were a coveted
article ior these standing thunderings’ (a passage oddly mis·
translated by Dr Dickson‚ E. T. lu. 295, and by Dr Holden
ad loc.); and this, he says, is the meaning of the passage in
Cicero. He had been accustomed to hire strong voices from
the theatre to applaud him: now these voices were used to turn
him into ridicule. But the narrative is too obscure for us to be
able to determine what kind ol cantores these were, and how they
cameto bc all singing together in a comoedia togata. 1 find no
other passage in which cautor appears to mean ‘actor’ ι Suet. Calig.
Lvu. is certainly not one. Cp. note on Cic. de Orat. 1. 60, 244.

lt't. maturiet so all MSS. Bentley’s matum's has found some
iavour; it gives at first sight an excellent antithesis to mobilebus,
while naturae are not'happily described as nubiles (cp. Ep. 1. 10,
24), and the trajection of et is quite in Horace's way. But alter
all maturus does not afford the best contrast to mobilis: and
arabilibus uatteris et anuas may be taken as a hendiadys ‘natures
that change with years '.

lue. reddero votes ‘reply in words ³, not ‘repeat words’
(as Or. and Schiitz) heard from the mother or the nurse: cp.
Verg. Aen. 1. 409 ueras audire et reddere voces, and Catuli.
wa. 166 nec missas audire qruuut uec reddere uoces.
