ARS POETICA ,

Tttn place now generally assigned to the Epistola ad Priona,
as the third epistle of the second book, rests upon no ancient
authority. In the Mssa always a pears, detached from the
other epistles‚ either after the F ourth iioolr of the Odes, orafter
the Carmen Saeculare. H. Stephanus first placed it at the
end of his edition: and Cruquius set the fashion, which has
recently been revived, of denoting it as Emstolarum Lib. 11.
Ep.111. The editors, who have given ir this position, seem to
have been led to do so by their view as to the date of its pro·

duction. It has been commonly sup sed to be the latest of ³

the works of Horaoe3 and the want o structural completeness,
which it undoubtedly displays, if regarded as a poetical treatise
‘on tbe Art os Poetry'‚ has been considered as a proof that it
was never finished, and probably was not published hythe poet
himself. This theory has been further confirmed by the assump-
tion made as to the identity of the Paiones, to whom the epistle
was addressed. Porphyrion begins his commentary with the

words ε hunc libram, qui inscribitur de arte poetc'ca, ad Lucium ³

Pisonem, quipostca urbis custosfuit, cuisque liberos misit ,· nam et
ipse Piso poeta fuit et studiorum liberalium antistes. This Lucius
Piso was the son of the enemy of Cicero: he was born Β. c. 48,
and was consul in n. c. 15. After some years’ absence in Pam·
phylia and Thrace he returned to Rome in tac. ιι, aad was
granted the insignia of triumph for his victories over the Bessi

(Tac. Annvt. ro). Under Tiberius he was praefectus urbium ,

office which be held for twenty years, according to Tacitus (cp.
Fumeaux on Tac. Ann. vr. rr, 5), dyingpin Α. Ι). 32 at tbe age of
80. Now it is just possible that this iso bad two sons, old
enough to be addressed as iuvenes, before the death of Horace
in lae. 8, and Borghesi believes that he has discovered evidence
that one of thern was consul suffetes in Μ). 7, in which case
he must have been born not later than tac. 26 (Mommsen Rem.
Staatsv. μ’ 553 note 4). But it is only by straining probabilities
to the arnust, that we can bring these young Pisos into con·
nexrou wrth Horace; and the difficulty thus arising makes ns
