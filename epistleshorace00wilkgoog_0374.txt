temporary lile and thought. ith this qualification, thereis no
reason why we should not accept the statement oi Porphyrion.
It is not necessary to assume that Horace borrowed from no
other sources: but Michaelis has sufficientlydisproved the theories
which would derive a large part oi this epistle hom Democritus,
Crito, Plato (in his Phaedrus), or Aristotle. From Varro he may

have obtained someduing, but we have no means oi determining ¹

how much.

The epistle is certainly not acomplete ‘Art of Poetry’. Some
important brauches oi the subject are omitted altogetherr others
are discussed with a iulness uite disproportionate to their im·
portance. It is sometimes di cult to trace the sequence oi the
remarks3 and digressions and repetitions appear to abound.
Many attempts have been made to remedy a disorder, which

was sup ed to have originated either in the unskilsulness oi r

those w 0 published, aster Horace's death, the fragmentary

drasts of a poem, to which his own revision would have given ¹

unity and completeness‚ or else in the poet's own ‘habitual in·
doleuce, which prevented his ever producinga complete work oi

any length’ (Macleane). But such attempts have had no real ,
basis to go uponr they have rarely satisfied any but their pro- ξ

pounders: and each suggested rearrangement has been declared
by later critics to make matters only worse. It has been too
commonly overlooked that very probably Horace intentionally
avoided iu this, as in other epistles, the appearance os a formal
regularity oi treatment. The epistle, like the Santra, from
which it originated, was oi the nature os a familiar chat, rather
than a set treatise, and precisely marked divisions ⁴and sub·
divisions were quite foreign to its nature. Stiil with the help
oi Prof. Nettleship’s valuable suggestion as to the relation ot' the
poem to its Greek source, we may find iu it traces oi au orderly
though not strictly systematic arrangement of subjecta.

The epistle may be divided into three main sections. In the
first (ι’-γα) the poet is enjoined to look to the unity of his style
and conception, and to avoid all that is out os keeping. In the
second (73-288) these general principles are applied to the
various kinds of poetry, and especially to the drama, which is
dhouned at length. In the third (289—476) the manisold re·
quates [or a successful cultivation of poetry are dwelt upon, aad ,
