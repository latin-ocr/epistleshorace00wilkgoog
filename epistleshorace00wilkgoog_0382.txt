43. lam nuno, ‘at once'‚ ‘at this very'time’, Ep. 11. 1,
127, Carm. 11. 1, 1⁷3 111. 6, ²3² the proper arrangement is
secured by not saying anything which is not immediately neces·
sary to the clear comprehension of the 'narrative or the sentiment.
Bentley argues 'that iam nunc—iam nunc can only mean ‘ai one
time—at another time', quoting Pers. v. 110 iam nunc astringas,
iam nunc granart'a laxes? where it certainly has this meaning.
He therefore takes away the comma after dici. But the sense
which results ‘to say sometimes [evetything]‚ and sometimes to
postpone much that ought to be said ', is so poor that we cannot
possibly accept it. “

44. pleraque ‘much’ as in Ep. 11. 1, 66 (note) : so plerum·
que ‘often' in Ep. 1., 18, 94, and above in v. 14.

differat expresses rather the purpose of the poet, oms'ttat bis
action: hence there is no tautology.

ta-su. Bentley first transposed these two lines, so that hoc
-lsoc means ‘oneword-another word'3 many of the best recent
editors have followed him, and his reasoning seems to, be irre·
sistiblycogent. No error is more common in MSS. than the
omission of a verse, which afterwards is restored to a wrong
place: and hoc-hoc seems almost inexplicable‚ if referred to the

topic of order. It is extremely otiose tosaythutthecomposerof l

a poem long promised is to make a selection of his subjeet-
matter. Schiitz attempts to defend the traditional order, bnt
with little success. His argument that debat, drfflrat and nminat
need auctor as a subject is not strong: the subject is easily
supplied from hunc of v. 41 ε and the change to the second per·
son dinetus is not hamb, and does not require the introduction of
a new theme. ’
