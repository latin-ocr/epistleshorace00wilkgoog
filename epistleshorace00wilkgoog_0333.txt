; 13. mangonum, ‘the slave-dealers’. The derivation of the

word manga (which the dictionaries based on Freund by an over·
sight say is post-Augustanj from μάγγανον ‘a charm or philtre’‚
commonly given is incorrect. The words may be ultimately
alrin3 but the meanings diverge too widely to admit oi direct
derivation. It can hardly be doubted that manga is identical
with our -manger (A.·S. mangere ‘a dealer’), Germ. -menger,
from mangz'an ‘to traffic', and ultimately from mang‘a mixture’.
The use oi mangam'ca, etc. with the notion of ‘to deck out, set
off’is later, and seems to be derived from the practice oi the
mangones, and not ae'ee versa.

correpsit in scalas (quoted by Schol. vet. on Juven. vn. 118).

madentis not to be connected with in scalis, as is done by
Acron, though he inconsistently adds (in Hauthal's text) et in
media danea ad timorem incutisndum habena pendebat, which is
doubtless correct. Tm whip (babma=larum‚ asin Verg. Aen.
vn. 380 of the whip used by a boy to lash his top) was hung up
iu some conspicuous part of the house.

16. des nummos, there are three possible ways of taking
this phrase: (1) as a hypothetical subjunctive in apodosis to si
