why the lists of the cives sine suffragio were called the tabulae
Caeritum. Gellius xvl. 13 asserts that the inhabitants of
Caere were made mandebas sine suffragii r'ure because they
took charge ef the Roman sacra at the time of the Gallie

what was originally a mark of honour sor the Caerites became
a badge of inferiority, after they had been defeated ln an attempt
to throw off their connexion with Rome (cp. Madvig, op. cit.

EPISTLE VII.

The date of this Epistle has been given by Ritter as the
autumn of tae. nr. He argues from Ep. 1· a, a that Horace
was et this time at Praeneste, within view of the Alban hills
(v. ro), and was intending to go down ,to Velia or Salernum
sor the winter (Ep. 1. 15). In this year also Augustus left
sich for the East, and sent Agrippa (now married to Julia)
to t e charge of home affairs3 hence Maecenas was relieved of
his more important public duties, and would have beenan the
more at leisure to enjoy the society of Horace, so that he com·
plained of his absence. But there are too many conjectural

linha in this chain of argument to enable us to accept it with
