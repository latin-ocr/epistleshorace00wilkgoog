NOTES. 349

' 68. nuta is not often used for opera, perhaps never in
prose: but Ovid Her. x. 60 has non hominum vedeo, non ego
saeta boum, where the last words translate ἔργα doeio: so that '
Bentley’s substitution of cuncta is needless.

69. nedum-stet, Roby§ 1658, S. G. ἓ 688. Key's notion

’ (L. G. δ 1228), that existumes is omitted for the sake of brevity‚

will not stand examination. But in cases like the present Mr
Roby's way of stating the usage needs to be modified or rather
inserted: the ‘greater event', ie. the perishing of all works of
men, is rhetorically regarded as having forits purpose the pre-
vention of the ‘less event ³, the continued currency of words.

umanum, a very rare, perhaps un paralleled use of the plural,
for ‘style' or ‘language’. Carm. 111. 8, 5 docte sermones utrius-
que linguae is quite different, if the usual interpretation is correct. “

to. multa renascentur: archaisms were much affected by
the writers of the second century after Christ, such as Fronto,
A. Gellius, and Apuleius. Our own time has similarly wit·
. nessed a great revival of archaic words in poetry.

'lte Homerus: the invention of the hexameter was ascribed
to the Delphic priests, and it is no improbable conjecture that
the earliest epic poetry-which in any case must have existed
“ for centuries before thellliad· assumed its present form—was of
purely religious origin. Cp. Mahaffy's Greek Liternum, 1. pp.
15-17· The hexameter arose,‘ as may be seen from the im·
portance of the caesura, fruma combination of two short lines,
the first normally -νν Ι ew Ι -, the second the same in struc-
ture but with an arracrusis, 'and an added syllable at the end
·- Ι -w Ι -ἣν Ι - ΙΙ ··. From this the pentameter was formed
by the omission of the added elements in the second half. Thus
the character of the verse was entirely changed. Cp. Cole-
ridge's version of Schiller's lines:

In the hmameter reses the forentaz'n's siloem column:
In the pentameter aye falling in nulody back.
