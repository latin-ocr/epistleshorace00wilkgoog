INTROBUCTIOM xvii

’ after stc. 13, and regards the Ars Pretrta as 'nnfinished
and not published by Horace himself. ’

§a ave componam praeeperat. '

Born in nc. 65, Horace was studying at Athens
at the time of the death of Caesar in lae. 44
He joined Brutus, and was made military tribune,
thus *occasionally at least taking the command of a
legion. In ne. 43 he appears to have been with
Brutus in Asia (Sat. i. 7, 18): in nc 42 be took part,
, though not a very distinguished part, in me battle of
Philippi. His return to Rome probably followed in
the next year ; bnt some time must be supposed to
have elapsed before his talents can have won for him
the friendship of Vergil and Varius, and warranted
them in introducing him to Maecenas. After me first
introductiorr, nine months passed before Maecenas
admitted him to his circle (Satio, 61). Hence we
cannot well assign to this an earlier date than nc 39.
With this date correspond' the indications os Satire i.
1 5, apparently to be ascribed to rae. 37, and of Sat ii.

, 6, 40, written, as it seems‚.in ac 31, when the friend·

ship had already lasted seven or eight years. In the
latter year Horace was already in possession of his

when he received it, but apparently it was not long
before this time· During the time covered by the
’ Satires (about nc. 40-30) Horace does not appear
