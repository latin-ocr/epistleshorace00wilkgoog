Horace did not recite his own poems: but the very passage to

w. grammancw Porph. takes tribua to refer to the
crowds ot scholars, pulpita ‘chairs’ to the teachers· But as the
metaphor is evidently that oi a candidate courting the suffragiis
ot the Roman tribes at an election, and as the grammarians
themselves, rather than their pupils, would be the voters, it is

the old man saw her (v. 125) percussit ilico animum. Atat,

phrase became proverbial, and was used as here even when there
was no question oi actual tears. Cp. Cic. pro Cael. 25· 61 rin
