116 HORATI EPISTULAE.

Actium, although from Acron’s note it would appear that he did
not understand it so, for Cassius served both with Sex. Pompeius
aud with Antonius against Augustus. The letter in Cic. E .
Fam. ΧΗ. 13is perhaps from this Cassius (Drumann 11. 161—1635,
but cp. Ramsay iu Dict Biog. 1. 627b. He is to be carefully
distinguished from the Cassius Etruscus of Sat. 1. 10, 61,
although the Scholiasts all confuse them.

For opuscula of literary works cp. Ep. 1. 19, 35. It is used
in the same way by Cic. Parad. 5.

4. tuter reptare: many MSS. write these as one word. But
Ms. evidence on such a point is worth little, and the word is ·
quite unknown elsewhere. Cp. Carm. 111. 15, 5; 111. ay, 513
Sat. 1. 6, 58-59; Epist. 11. a, 93-945 A. Ρ. 4²5 internoscere.

reptare ‘stroll’z the frequently asserted identity of repo and
serpo is more than doubtful: the meaning differs, serpo never
being used of men, except metaphorically (Α. Ρ. 28), and repo
often, and the phonetic process assumed is supported only by the
doubtful parallel of re'te (Curt. 1. 330, 441).

salubris Ep. 11. a, 77. Tibullus says of himself (tv. 13, 9
Epigr. i. Baehrens, p. 84) sic ego secretis possum bene vivere
siloes, qua nulla huncano sit via tre’ta pede.

θ. eras: Many commentators take as τέφυςε ‘nascenti tibi
non solum corpus sed etiam pectus eximium datum est.’ Ritter‚
which is hardly a possible force for the tense. Others explain
‘semper quamdiu te cognovi'. It is simplest to say ‘you used
not to be, when we were together, which certainly does not
imply (as Macleane says) a doubt whether he is so still. Prof.
Palmer adds “Prop. 1. 13. 34: Non alio limine dagnus eras.-
eras=es but stronger, ‘you are not and never were’. I‘think
the idiom is the same as in quanto laborabas Charybdi.”

pectore, not, as Macleane says, for the' ‘intellect¹, but the
‘soul'. including os course the mental faculties, but denoting
especially the emotional side. In his own quotation from
Quintilian (x. 7, 15) pectus estquod disertos facit, et vis merdas,
the context makes this quite clear: habenda in oculis, in adfectus
rece'pienda: pectus est enim etc....a'deoque imperitas quoque, si modo
sunt alapae adfectu conarere, verba non desunt. Cp. the famous
saying of Augustine ‘pectus facit theologum’. So in Ov. Met.
xm. 290 rudis etsinepectore miles ‘a rough ancl soulless soldier’:
Her. xvr. rof-a huncine tu speres hominem sine pectore dotes
posse satis formae, Tyndari, nosse tuae? where it is a man with-
out a soul for beauty. Often we may best translate ‘heart',
e.g. de Orat. 111. 30, 121. Here are however instances where
the intellectual part seems the more prominent: eg. Sat. 11. 4,
