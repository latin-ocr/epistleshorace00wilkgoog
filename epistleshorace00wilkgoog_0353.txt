earliest stages of the lauguage. It is difficolt to find this in the
text3 Popes imitation is based upon a similar interpretation
(‘ For use will father what's begot by sense ¹). The fact is that
Horace is not speaking here of mining new terms, so much as
adopting and so stamping with his sanction those which have
but lately become current, and are not yet recognized as classical.
Hence adeoieoet which is used of admitting strangers to the
franchise, or recruits into a legion. It is impossible to resist the
force oi the parallel passage in A. Ρ. 70-72, or we might be
tempted to give to usus the sorce of ‘his needs’, os in Sat. 1. 3,
roa arnrr's, quoe post fabricaverat usus.

‘New phrases, iu the world oi books unknown,
So use but father them, he makes his own.’ Con.

mo. vemens: cp. note ou v. 28. The poet must have the
swilt strong rush of a iull stream, without losing cleamess and
purity of style. Cicero Brut. 79, 274 says of M. Calidius: pri·
mum ita pura crat [oratio], utniltil liquidius, ira liureflueoat,
utnusquam adhaermceret.

121. beabit, a favourite word with Horace (E . 1. rt, 753
Carm. 11. 3, 7,1v. 8, 29). but not osten used elsewhere, except
, in the comic ἔξεις. It may perhaps be reckoned (as by Walz)

pared'to the rank growth of trees not dul pruned. The meta·
phorical reference is confirmed, not, as Schiltz thinks, disproved
by compescet: cp. Verg. Georg. 11. 370 raneos compesce fluentis:
ib. 1. 112 luxuriem segetum tenera depascit in herba: Cic. de
Orat. 11. 23, 96 luxuries stilo depascenda est (ie. must be kept

12³. virtute, not ‘merit’, but rather ‘energy, vigour‘.
The other faults can be set right: this admits ol nothing but
complete excision.

‘But show no mercy to an empty line’. Pope.

Orelli, overlooking this, thinks that there would be atautology
aster compescet, aud would translate tollet ‘will raise’‚ i.e. add
force to. His first quotation from Quintilian is garbled: ior the
second, 1v. a, 61 supra modum se tollens oratio would have been
more to the point. But it is not likely that Horace would have
used a term so likely to he misunderstood. Cp. Plaut. Asin.

83 ergo, ut iubes, tollam, i.e. ‘1 will strike it out’. The codd.
issand. and some other MSS. have calentia. To defend this, and
interpret tollet oi a iether ‘tanquam infantem natum, ut nutriat

educatque’ is the blindest partisanship.
