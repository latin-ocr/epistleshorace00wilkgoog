tion which certainly raises more difficulties than it removes.

The view taken by Ritschl ol this passage can hardly be
said to be certain, in face of the corrupt state of our scanty
authorities; but it isat least more plausible than any other
interpretation as yet put forward. Orelli ignores it, Schiita

true, and is by no means to his discredit’ (bellat, Roman Poets,

were acted. Terence is said to have received 8000 sesterces for
his Eunuchus, more than any play had produced before.
