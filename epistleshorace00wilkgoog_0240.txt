ln Shakspere‚ l.c.‚ ‘we have the receipt of fem-seed, we wall<
invisible'), a derivation accepted by Donaldson on the strength ol
the more than doubtful identity of Larinas and Latinus. Acron
connects the word with lavare, thieves being called lavatores, I
suppose, henaim they ‘clean out’ travellers. But the only legi·
timate derivation is hom the root lu or lau ‘to gain ', found in
ἁπο-λαύ-ω, hats, lucrum, latro, etc. (Curt. Gr. Etyrm. No. 536).
Arnobius Iv. aa says ol Lauerna, cum Mercurio simul fraudibus
praesidet furtivis. Preller, Rom. Mytt. p. 218 (cp. p. 459) con-
siders Lanam a bye·form of Lara (the Dea Muta and Mater
aarum), a goddess of the dark and silent under-world, and hence
the patroness of thieves (as St Nicholas is said to have acquired
his functions srom a confusion with ‘Old Nick’)‚ but this does
not account satisfactorily lor the sorm of the word.

n. anonumum. l.31‚ 17.

tusto memque restored by Bentley from the vet. Bland. and Ἴ
other good MSS. lor the old reading iustum sanctumque, which .

is only a copyist’s alteration: cp. Sat. 1. 1, 19 atqui licet esse

beatis, 1. 6, 25 fierique tribuno. Cp. Roby51357, S. G.

§.537 lcl·

6². obtoo: the form obiice is found in no good MS. here, or
in Carm. 111. 10, 3. Roby§ 144.

88-72. One who is a slave to tiis laser possiunt is rto free
nean, but should be treated as a conrardly prisoner os war, and set
to some usqicl tait.

63. qut ‘how’: Ep. 1. 6, 423 Sat. 11. a. 193 3, 241, 260,
275, 311, etc.

64. ln trinus hum: repeated by Pers. v. 111 inque luto ¹

fixum possis transcendere nummum, where the scholiast says that

it wasacommon joke with boys at Rome to solderacoin to the ἓ
pavement (assem in silice plumbatum infigere) in order to ridi· ¹

cule those who stooped to pick it up, cryrng ‘try again l’ Schiitz
considers this a forced explanation, and takes fixum as ‘stick-

ing’, somewhat as in Sat. II. 3, 294. The exaggerated phraseos ¹

Petronius c. XIIII. ab asse crevit et paratus fuit quadrantem de
stercore mordicus tollere rather points to this view. ¹

tt. mint ‘in my eyes’ Robyfi 1148, S. G. 5477.

st. perdidit arma i.e. is a ῥίψασπις, ‘a coward who has
flung away his arms. Bentley showed that this phrase was quite

the correct one: ‘prodereenimsigwa publica recte dixeris: pn· p

vata cuiusque arnse non item: sed tradere arma, eicere, abicere,
amittere, perdere’. Cp. Plaut. Epid. 55 (Goetzl rit mc peritate.
quis? itte qui arata perdidit.
