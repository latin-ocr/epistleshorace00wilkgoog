Itis a mistake also to suppose that a chorus was not introduced
in Roman tragedies: it not merely sang its songs between the
scenes, but took part in the action (cp. Ribbeck Rdnr. Trug. pp.
637-9). But as the orchestra was fitted up with seats in the
Roman theatre, the chorus must have talren aplace upon the stage,
¹and thus been more closely connected with the action than in
Greek tragedy. Aristotle says (Poet. xvrtt. 19) rat τὸν χορὸν δὲ
ἕνα δεῖ ὑπολαβεῖν τῶν ὑποκριτῶν rui μόριον εἶναι τοῦ ὅλουκαὶ
συναγωνίζεσθαι, μὴ ὥσπερ παρ’ Εὐριπίδῃ ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ παρὰ Bodo-

with the plot. For Sophocles cp. Campbellb Sophocles o x111.

have chosen. Hence, on very slight authority, he read pacare
lanternis, and this reading has been adopted by some ood'
editors, eg. Meineke, Haupt, and Ι. Miiller. It has heen
argued that tumentis isat least as tautologous after iratos as the
MS. reading aiter bonis, and that anretpacare is by uo means a
natural expression ior pacet. The tormer objection Bentley anti·
cipated by pointing out that tumidus is used for the result not
only of anger, but also os grief (Cic. Tusc. 111. ra, 26; 31, 76),
to which Orelli adds pride, comparing Sat⁴ 11. 3, ²¹3 purum est
vilio tibi, cum rancidum est cor? Doederlein warmly defends
and Keller accepts pacare timentis ; which Bentley suggests as
an alternative, comparing Senec. Ep. mx. nil stultitia pacatum
habemani superne illi metus cst, quam infra. On the whole
there is (as Munro says) no sufficient reason ior departing srorn
the Mss, though Bentley’s reading gives what Horace mightwell
harre written. The chorus should show their affection ior heroes
or heroines, who though tempted to commit a sin shriuk from
doing so. ,We may perhaps with Ritter take bonis as nearly
equal to fortibus, those who teet no temptation to go wrong.
