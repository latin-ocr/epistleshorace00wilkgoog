Aristotle Poet. lv. 17 διὰ τὸ ἐκ σατυρικοῦ μεταβαλεῖν, which

contradiction, this is but a lame way of removing it. But tlte
fact seems tabe that while tragedy. originated in the song of a
band of satyra-as Aristotle implies-and hence for a time
tragedy and the satyrical drama were identical, as it developed,

of Aeschylus, restored the chorus of satyra, and wrote lays for
