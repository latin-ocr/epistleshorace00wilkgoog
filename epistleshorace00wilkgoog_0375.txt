the young Pisos are warned of the difficulties which surround

the poet who is not fitted by learning, genius, and painstaking'
labour for his high vocation. The further development ol these
general divisions must be reserved for the running analysis. But
one point calls lor further remark, in the space which is given to·

. the criticism of the drama. While only ²4 lines are assigned·

to epic poetry, no less than 170 are devoted to dramatic poetry÷
For this various reasons have been given. It has been suggested
that Horace himself, who was certainly not without dramatic
tritrialth{tsstktlklll¹0¹}ssrittltritttiknltt
to be running dry. Others have found the explanation in the ,
hypothesis that the young Pisos had shown tendencies in that
direction. But without denying the possibility of either of these

and among his own set. In the generation of Cicero dramatic
literature had fallen out of favour ; aud though Quintus Cicero
was proud of having written four tragedies in sixteen days, the
rapidity of the production shows how little it was regarded as a
serious pursuit. But of Horace's contemporaries some of those
of highest mark had devoted themselves to tragedy. Asinius
Pollio', Varius, and Ovid, all won h· h distinction in this branch
of literature, and alth'ough Augustus ad the good sense to cancel
his own tragedy of Ajax, the fact that he had written it shows
the direction which the current was taking. It is probable that
Horace, in devoting so much attention to the criticism of the
drama, did so in recognition of the prevalent literary tastcs, and
with the wish to influence them in the direction of profounder
study ol the true classical models. ·

Porphyrion says primm acceptum cst περὶ τῆς ἀκολουθίας, i. e.
consistency in dealing withhhe several portions (vv. 1—9). Prof.
Nettleship suggests that the praeceptum of Neoptolemus is trans·
lated or paraphrased in vv. 1-5, and that 6-9 form Horace’s
comment. In pointing the neglect of organic unity results in a
ridiculous monster: the effect is not less absurd in poetry.
