¹ 336 Ares ponerem ww

malunt (pictores), caeruleum sublinunt, mou prementum euouo
indutum. Bentley objected to plumas as denoting only the
featbers covering the body, not the virg-feathers which be
thought the context required. The distinction though usually
·is not always observed, and is not in question here: the
monstrous torm is representedas having the body of ahird, which .
would be covered with plumae.

8. undique conaus memhris, probably the dative aller
inducere, not the abl. abs. (as Orelli thinks), for the indirect
object alterinducere can hardly be spared: sicis understood from
the following ut, as in v. 8etc. ‘and to spread feathers oi

varied hues over limbs brought together from all sides in such a =

way that' dec. Ritter places a comma at plumat, understand·

ing inducere simply os the horse’s neck (with et ei understood), ’

and takilpegl collatis membris as abl. abs. 'lhis leaves the body
un esen .

trrpttor mm go together, as in Ep.1. 3, aa turpiter '

hirtum: otrnnr=fhedum ‘bideous’z Ep. 11. r, 189.
4. ln piscem ‘in beluam marinam, i. e. pistricem’ Acron,

whence some have read atraere...in pristim: cp. VergAen. 111. ’

427 postrema immani corpore pistn'u of Scylla, x. ω’ in pristim ,
desinit alvus of Triton. [For the form of the¹ word cp. ¹
Nettleship on Aen. 111. 427.] But the general teror is· at least
as good as the more specific one, ifnot better. ι .

o. arcuatum ‘to a private view ’‚ of course tbe'sitpine. ‘

t. aegri seems to have rather more authority than aegnir
which Keller defends, and it is a better parallel to miur- nm
‘unreal’. Cp. Ep. 11. 1, eto (note).

8. urentur is required mersere, by the sequence of tenses,
not finguntur.

rudes ‘lancies’r vanae species, as Schiitz 'points out, are not
in themselves blameworthy in a work oi imagination: only they
rsppan fppprbe inconsistent, like the dreams ot a man suffering

neo pes noo capnt, a metaphor suggested by the comparison
with a picture. Cp. Plaut. Asin. 729 nec caputnec pessumae·
adparet. Capt. 614 garriet quei meque pes umquam neque caput
compareat. Cic. ad Fam. vn. 31, r tuas res ita cataractas, ut,
queamdmodum scribis, nee caput necpedes. ,

unt proleptic: ita ut unufiat.

⁹. reddatur ‘is adapted to’. ‘Natura rerum dat, poeta
reddit ut debitum’ Or.
