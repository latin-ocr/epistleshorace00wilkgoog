arenant seems to have quite as much authority as deiecerit ·
which Keller and Schutz prefer: ‘ideo hicpraeferendum proiece- ¹
rit, quia proicere animam, proicere se, quae inbonis scriptoribus
vsaepe occurrunt, ubique habent significationem voluntarii discri-
minis deque eo dicuntur, qui servari aut nolit aut desperat
Bentl. Keller's argument that defeceritis better after decidit and
demittere seems to me to point the other way.

483. memque poetas The accounts of the death of Empe·
docles varied: the best authenticated is that after an active poli·
tical life in Agrigentum he was compelled to leave it and retire to
the Peloponnesus, where he died (probably‘about mc. 4 32) ε his
followers seem afterwards to have invented in his honour a myth
that he had disappeared· mysteriously at a sacrificial banquet3
while his enemies accounted for his disappearance hysa ing that
he had thrown himself down the crater of Etna, in the ope that
he might be considered to have been carried to heaven, but that
the trick was discovered when one of his bronze sandals was cast
up by the volcano. Others said that he had been killed 'bya fall
from a chamot, that he had hanged himself, or that he had been
drowned byaccident: cp. Diog. Laert vttt 63ss. Zeller, Gr.
Phil. 1.² 500 (note). Mr Matthew Amold in his splendid poem ’
‘Empedocles on Etna’ accounts for the suicide as that of one
who was ‘dead to lise and joy‘ from broodiug over the problems
of human life and destiny.

τος, οὐκέτι θνητός. Empedocles was a strong heliever in metem-
{scylchrogsgs and this may have been distorted into the basis of such

405. nitidus, explained by Acron as stultus: ‘Empedocles
enim ,dicebat ¹tarda ingenia frigido circ'a praecordia'sanguine
rmpedrrr‘. His own hue rs αἱμα γὰρ ἀνθρωποις περικαρδιονέστι
νόημα, from which, as Conington remarks on Verg. Georg. 11. 484,
the statement of Acron is at any rate a natural inference. But
the reference is too obscure to have been intended by Horace
here. namtas is rather ‘in cold blood’: Schtitz objects that it

helped out 'by the antithesis-itself very frigid, if it were not in
Jest—with ardentem, it may bear this meaning. It is better at
any rate than Schiitz's ‘because he was cold'.
