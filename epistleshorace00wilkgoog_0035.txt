INTROD UCTION. xxvii

demarcatiou cannot always be drawn very definitely.
Many Mss, vary between two or even three classes,
‘and there is nota single ΜΞ which can be regarded
as always a faithful representative of the class to
which he assigna it. Thus A and E often give the
readings of Class II. rather than Class I., while F
sometimes falls into Class I., and the Rrr family con-
stantly wavers between them An even more serious
objection is taken to the estimate which Keller forms
of Class IL, and to the weight which he gives to V.
In an edition of Horace, published in 1578, Jacobus
Cruquius, professor at Bruges, frequently quoted the
readings of four Mss, which he said he had collated
in the Benedictine monastery at Blankenburgh (Mons
Blandinius) near Ghent, but which were shortly after-
wards (before the publication of his edition) destroyed
by tire during the civil wars. These Mss were
thought by Cruquius to be about 700 years old 3 and
would thuefore belong to the ninth century: one,
known as venundatus, he considered to be decidedly
older, perhaps by 200 years The reading of these
MSS. differs in many places from the received text,
and it has always been a moot point among scholars
what weight is to be attached to them. Bentley set
a very high value upon their evidence, especially
where, the vetustissimus was expressly quoted. His
doctrine on this point, as on Horatian criticism gene·
rally, is accepted by the ‘Berlin school', represented
by Lachmann, Meineke‚ Haupt and Lucian Miiller.
