352 Ans Poarrce.

81. popularis mortus, the-murmur which always rises
from any large assembly, and drowns everything but the clearest
and most marked elocution. The frequent recurrence oi the
ictus in iambic rhythm makes it sharper and more easily audible
than a metre which contains more short syllables. Cp. Cic. de
Orat. 111. 47, 182 (note).

82. tratum rebus agendis ‘suited by their nature to action’.
So Arist· Poet. xx1v. 10 τὸ δὲ ἰαμβικὸν καὶ τετράμετρον κινητικά,
τὸ μὲν ὀρχηστικὸν, τὸ δὲ πρακτικόν.

88. fidibus, dat. ‘to the lyre'. The object oi deditis
referre: cp. Roby S. G. 5 534, and v. 3²3 dedit-loqui. The
two main divisions oi lyric (or more properly melici poetry
were (ι) the Dorian‚ or choric poetry‚ beginning with Terpander
os Lesbos, who flourished at Sparta u-c. 670-640, and in·
cluding Alcman, Thaletas‚ Arion, Stesichorus, Ibycus, and most
famous oi all Simonides and Pindar: this was public, choral,
and elaborate in rhythm‚ and its subjects were religious or
rational, including the glory of uictors in the games: (a) the
Aeolio, os which Alcaeus, Sappho and Anacreon were the chief
representatives and in which personal emotions were expressed
in simplet metrical forms. To the tormer Horace refers in vv.
83, 84, to the latter in v. 85.

86. libert. ulna ‘the sreedom os wine’, practically equivalent
to ‘the wine which frees men’ from their cares (Ep. 1. 5, 16 f.);
or else. as Orelli takes it, of the free speech of those who have
drunk much wine (cp. Sat. 1. 4, 893 11. 8, 37).

rsa-11⁸. Not only must the right diction (45-72) and the
fitting metre (73-86) be chosem but also the proper tone and
style must he maintained. Horace here begins to deal es ecially
with dramatic poetry‚ which he keeps in view almost excimively
up to v. ²94· One who caneret keep up tlte n'ght tone in treating
Iris characters does not deserat tlte name ofpoet. Τ ragcdy and
comedy leave eaclr their a propnate style, though sometimes they
seem to pass into each otker. A successfiel play must touch the
seelings os tlte audietne, and for this language well adopted to
tlte position and character oftlte personage must be employed.

8⁶. dampna ‘marked out'‚ assignedto tragedyaudcomedy
respectively. Biicheler would read here against all MSS. dir-

cnptar ‘apportioned¹. For the difference between the words ,

cp. Cic. de Sea. a, 53 and ιγ, 59 with Reid’s notes. ,

’ vices seems never to mean ‘parts', the translation often
given to it here. Comparing Carm. rv. 7, 3 mutat terra umes
we see that vices may denote the states into which a thing posses
hy change, as well asthe changes themselves. Here it is ‘the

differences'. operumque colores is added to explain vaes: cp
