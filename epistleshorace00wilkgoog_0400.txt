publica materies, not as ‘what is operito all’, but as ‘what is
familiar to all’. Translate then with Conington (p. 199 note),
‘Itis hard to treat hackneyed subjects with originality’i This
interpretation is found (among others) in the Schol. Cruq. The
first view has the weighty support of Proi. N ettleship (Joum.
Phil. xii. 5² note), but Ι thin the third ison the whole the
best. There is a discussion of the passage in Boswell's Life of
Johnson, c. xxx.

poetry. It is not legitimare to say, with Ritter‚ that deducis
would in prose have been deducas. The metaphor is the iami-
liar one from spinning3 cp. Ep. 11. 1, 2²5². hence the reading
diducis oi some MSS. isout of place. Aristotle (Poet. 23) says
that the Iliad and the Odyssey iumish material lor one or at
most two tragedies each, while several could· be made from
Cyclic poems such as the Littlo Iliad or the Cypria. But cp.
Mahaffy‚ Gr. Lit. 1. 83.

passage, the store of mythic and epic stories, from which all
, might draw at will. But it is better to take it as ‘themes
already handled’‚ which can be made all a poet’s own, by origi·
nality of treatment. Orelli’s own example of the story of
Electra, as treated by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, is a
very good one, but less applicable to his own view, than to that
here preferred. Cp. Milton’s name ‘sad Electra's oet ’, which
{fiows how he thought that Euripides had apprhpriated the
eme.

“ os the mode oi treatment previously adopted. A familiar theme
may be so treated that the situations which it produces may be
viewed in a different light, and the reflexions (sententiae) sug·
gested may be quite fresh. of this there is a splendid example
iu Browning’s Balaustion's Adventare. I do not think that
Schiitz is right in referring orbis to a set of familiar stories, ior
which Ritter reminds us that κύκλος was the technical name;
and certainly Orelli's quotations of sci κύκλῳ from Aristotle's

Rhetoric are quite misleading, and his rendering ‘round-about
phrases' highly improbable.
