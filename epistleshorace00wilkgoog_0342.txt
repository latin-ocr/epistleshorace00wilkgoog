τι. ualidum ‘in hot haste’3 cp. Sat. 1. 3, 53: Carm. ιιι.
14, ιγ, where however the meaning is rather ‘impetuous’.

germane, instmmental ablatives, indicating how the con·
tractor showed his impetuosity. lt is quite illegitimate to say
with Macleane that ‘cunc is omitted': Kriiger compares military
expressions such as ingenti exercitu, ammom capiti, uadrato
agucinc: but the addition of the epithet makes all the ' erence

plostra ducenta concurrantque foro tria futura. The form plas-

annularem, adnconc'tus abta, plaustra patius quam plostra dicenda,
postero dc'e Flaurum salutavit. The nse of w eeled vehicles
was forbidden in Rome until ten hours after sunrise, except in
the case of those employed in connexion with public buildings,
temples, etc. (as probably here and in Juv. ιιι. 214), of market·
