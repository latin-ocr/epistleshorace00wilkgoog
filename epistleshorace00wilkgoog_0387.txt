though planned by Julius Caesar, was, according to the best

abl. of that from which it is defended. In prose it is more

common to have the acc. of the thing kept off, and the ablative
(with ab) ol that from which it is kept off.

05. regis opus: Meineke thinks the singular here inde-
fensible, holding that it could only mean ‘the work of one who
was a king', a title always reJ'ected by Augustus, as by Julius:
and therefore suggests regium opus, like regiae ntales in Carm. 11.
15, 1. The suggestion has found much favour: and 1 am by no
means sure that the vulgate can be defended. Cp. Theocr. 1. 3²
γυνά τι θεῶν δαίδαλμα.

palus din The MSS. read otu palus: Bentley first ob
jected to the unparalleled shortening of paliis, and suggested
palus prius: Gesner’s palus diu, in which the long vowel is not
elided but shortened in hiatus, has in its favour sa' ml antas of
Sat. 1. 9, 38 and Vergil Ecl. vm. 108 an qul marat, Aen. vl..

and Catullus: cp. Munro on Lucr. 11. 404 and Lachm. Comm.
p. 176· Although we cannot very confidently ascribe it to Ho-
race here, especially as the instances apparently similar shorten
the vowel iu the first not the second thesis, it is less improbable
than the shortening ol the final syllable of paliis, to which uo
sort of parallel can be adduced. Hence the best recent editors
admit it. But I am by no means sure that Bentl'ey’s palus prius

is not a safer correction. PRIV would easily become DIV.
Or if it dropped out after palus, diu might be inserted to make
out the line. Macleane entirely misunderstands Quint. 1. 7, 3
which in no way ‘shows that later poets had followed Horace's
licence'. Both Servius and Priscian had the reading of the
MSS. and remark upon the shortened final syllable, but quote ¹
uo other instance of it. ¹

sterlllsve, though it has not much more authority than steh-
quue, is clearly the better reading.

. The scholiasts explain this to refer to the draining of the t
Pomptine marshes by Augustust Pomptinas paludes Augustus l
exsiccavit at habitabiles reddidit iniecto aggere lapidum et terrae. l
