1. Vertumnum. Vertumnus seems to have been originally
the god of the annus uertens, ie. both of the spring and of the
autumn, but especially of the latter with its rich stores oi fruit:
cp. Colum. x. 30⁸ mercibus et uernis diues Vertumnus abundet:
Propert. 1v. a, 11 seu quia uertentis fructuni praecepimus anni,
Vertumni rursus creditatessc sacrum. Perhaps it was only
from the significance of his name that he was credited with the
power of clianging himself into any form that he plessed. His
temple was in the Vicus Tuscus, one of the busrest streets in
Rome, full of all kinds of shops, and also of houses of ill repnte.
This circumstance may have contributed to the further explana-
tion os his name as the deus invertendum rerum, id est merca·
turae (Asconius in Verr. rr. 1, 154, p. 19 ). Propertius (lv. a)
has a charming poem upon him: and Ovi Met. xtv. 623 ff. tells
how he won the love of Pomona. Cp. Preller Rom. Mysi. p.

397-9·

Ianum z a temple of Janns was at the bottom ot* the Argile-
tum, which was not, as Macleane says, a street leading out of
the Vicus Tuscus, but on the opposite side of the Forum (Burn’s
Rome p. 79), near the Subura, ‘also a disreputable quarter.
There are references in Martial to the book-shops in the Argile-
tum (ι. 3, 1; 117, 9). Porph. says ‘Ianus quoque similiter vicus
est‘. Cp. Ep. 1. 1, 54 note. ν

specum ‘to have your eyes upon ’, with wistful longing. So
apparently in Verg. Ecl. 111. 48 si ad uitulum spectas.

Β. adlinet ‘of course' ironically, giving the reason in the
book’s mind.

pausus ‘be offered for sale‘, not without a double enteudre.

Sosiorm probably brothers, sreedmen of the family of the
Sosii, possibly of the C. Sosius praetor in B.c. 49. The are
mentioned as booksellers also in Α. Ρ. 345. In the 'reelr
writers who mention C. Sosius (Plutarch, Dio and Josephus) the
name is written with u: if this is correct, and not due simply to
assimilation to Σωσίθεος and the like, we must assume synizesis
of the iin both passages of Horace.

pumice: ‘after the volumen was eompleted and rolled up,
both ends of the closed roll were smoothed and polished with
pumice’ Munro Criticisms of Catullus p. 54, against Ellis’s
commentary on Catuli. xxrr. 8 pumue onznia aequata: cp.
Catull. 1. 1-u quoidam lepr'dum nouum libellum arido modo
pumice expolitum? Ov. Trist. 1. r, 11 uec fragili geminae po·
leantur pumice srusrtes. Mart. vrrs. 72, r nondum murs'cecultus
