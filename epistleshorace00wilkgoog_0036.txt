rilrviii INTRODUCTIOM

On tlre other hand Keller and Holder place these
MSS. along with B in the interpolated class, and
consequently rate them comparatively low. Keller’s

arguments are set forth in his Epilegomena, pp. 800 l

-8032 they hate been replied to by Dillenburger,
Mewes and most sully by Hoeltn in a dissertation
published at Jena in 1883 (pp. 5 3). The touclusion,

to which a caresul consideration os the readings os V i

in the Epistles has brought me, is given more than
once ¹iu the notes, and is identical with that which
Professor Palme'r 'expresses in the Presace to his
edition os the Satires (p. xxxi): ‘Iam disposed to l
tegard this famous codex as an interpolated descend· ¹
ant os a better archetype than that from which the
Horatian MSS. are descended.' At the same time,
it seems to be evident that its antiquity was over-
stated hy Cruquius‚ and that, as it was written in
minuscules, it could not hawe been earlier than the
tenth century.

With regard to the Epistles Hoehn's conclusion
is thatin Book I. out of 117 recorded readings, 80
are certainly right, 19 wrong, 18 doubtful: in Book 11.
of 38, aa are right,'5 wrong, rr doubtful 3 in the Ars
Portica of 32, ²3 are right, 1 wrong, 8doubtful.
These figures may be on some points open to ques· “
tion3 in particular, some of the readings noted as
doubtful are either almost certainly right, or point to
the true reading. But the general result is to show

how much better V stands such a test than any
