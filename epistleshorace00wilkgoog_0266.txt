226 HORATI EPISTULAE.

dinian MSS. (amonff otherslhave quiponit‚ but qui has been very

Itis almost necessary to have a limiting object to orare.

pontense very commonly used by Horace in the sense ol
‘lay down' (Caum. ιιι. ο, ι9; ιο, 3 ιν. ra, a5; Sat. 11. 3, 16;
Ep. 1. 1, 103 ιο, 31; 16, 35 3 ni. ⁴⁶9) that it is difficolt to
believe that he used the word here in the sense ol ‘bestow'.
The confusion between D and P is one of the most commonia
uncial Mss. The passage in earm ι. 34, 14 s. him apicem
rapax Fortuna cum stridore acuto sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet,
which decided Bentley, aiter some hesitation, to accept penalis

not closely parallel, forthere the action is more vividly pictured ,

than here. On the other hand, if pontt had come
corruption from donat we should have ex ected to find the
intermediate stage ponat (found in one S.) more widely
diffused; aud if ponat was the original reading. donat wouldbe
an almost inevitable gloss. Hence it is perhaps best on the

⁴ whole to retain ponit. [“1 take the word to have the meta·

EPISTLE XIX.

This Epistle recalls the tone of Satires w. and x. in Book

t. The epistolary form is more completely than elsewhere in ³

this book a mere form3 but it is natural that Horacefs scorn
of his imitators and reJoinder to his critics should be andresel

inthe first instance to his patron Maecenas. The letter cannot ³

be earlier than the publication oi the first three books citha
Odee: otherwise there is nothing to fix its date. It is evidently
separated by a considerable interval from Carm- ιν. 3, when
envions carping criticism had been silenced by the general

recognition oi the poet’s merite: Romae principat urbium dr}-
natur suboles inter amabiles vatum ponere macheras, et ww
